You are considered a first-time freshman applicant if you’ve completed AP, IB, and/or college credit courses during high school — including during the summer after graduation.
Applicants who have completed coursework at a college or university after high school graduation (excluding the summer) should apply for transfer admission.
Every student brings something unique to our community that encompasses achievements, experiences and viewpoints. All applicants are reviewed individually and holistically. Consideration is given to the following factors:
As Texas law requires, students will be automatically admitted to UT Dallas as first-time freshmen if they graduate in the top 10% of their class from an accredited Texas high school and successfully earn the Distinguished Level of Achievement. Applicants must have graduated from high school during one of the two school years preceding the academic year for which they seek admission as first-time freshmen and have not attempted any college-level coursework since graduation from high school.
Applicants admitted because they are in the top 10% of their high school class may be required to complete additional preparatory work before enrolling in the University or complete developmental coursework to remove any deficiencies in their readiness to complete college-level work before University graduation.
As required by Texas Senate Bill 1543, applicants who present evidence of obtaining a non-traditional secondary education (for example, those who were home-schooled or earned a GED instead of a high school diploma) will be assigned a percentile rank compared to the average class rank of students from traditional schools who have equivalent SAT or ACT test scores.
Students who are not admitted into their first choice of major due to capacity constraints or major-specific requirements may be offered admission to a different major as outlined in their acceptance letter.
International applicants must meet the criteria for freshman admission and additional steps, such as satisfying the English proficiency requirement. Be sure to review the international applicant’s webpage for a list of additional required materials for a complete application.
Our admission counselors are here to help guide you through the entire admission process — from choosing your school and submitting your application to preparing for enrollment.

An incomplete course grade (grade of I) must be completed within the time period specified by the instructor, not to exceed eight weeks from the first day of the subsequent long semester. If the work is not completed within the limit, the grade will be changed to “F”.

Primary Name
For information on changing names and addresses, please see the catalog.
Preferred Name
The University recognizes that many community members use names other than their primary/legal names to identify themselves. As long as the use of this different name is not for the purpose of misrepresentation, the University acknowledges that a preferred name may be used whenever possible in the course of university business and education.
The student is free to determine the preferred name they wish to be known by in the Orion student information system; however, inappropriate use of the preferred name policy may be cause for denying the request.
The student should send email from their UT Dallas email account to records@utdallas.edu to edit the preferred name.

Q: Can I get a Comet Card issued with my preferred name? A: Yes, Comet Cards can be updated to have preferred name on front and legal name on the back.
Q: Can I get an official transcript, the commencement program, or my diploma issued with my preferred name? A: No, the official transcript, the commencement program, and diploma are issued only with the primary/legal name.
Q: I have more questions regarding preferred name, who can I contact? A: Please email your questions to records@utdallas.edu. A member of the Registrar’s Office staff will respond.

The “Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act” (also known as the Wetterling Act) is a federal law enacted on October 28, 2000 that provides for the tracking of convicted, registered sex offenders enrolled as students at institutions of higher education, or working or volunteering on campus.
This act amends the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 to clarify that nothing in that Act may be construed to prohibit an educational institution from disclosing information provided to the institution concerning registered sex offenders and requires the Secretary of Education to take appropriate steps to notify educational institutions that disclosure of this information is permitted. Information about registered sex offenders may be found on:

How do I audit a course?
For more information on how to audit a course, please go to audit registration.
What is a hold or a service indicator?
Holds or service indicators are computerized mechanisms to prevent registration or transcript processing. Some service indicators are positive in nature and will not affect your ability to register or to receive an official transcript. When you have a hold or a negative service indicator affecting your registration or official transcript processing, you need to take steps to resolve the problem. You can check your holds or service indicators online.
What is an enrollment appointment?
During registration periods, the enrollment appointment is your date and time slot you are able to registration for the term. To locate your enrollment appointment, go to your UTD Student Center, Manage My Class tile, Enrollment Appointments page and select the appropriate term. Register for classes after your enrollment appointment begins for the term. Online registration is available until the published last day of late registration.
I withdrew from UT Dallas last semester and I would like to reenter this semester. What do I need to do?
If you completely withdrew from the previous semester before the 20th class day, the Office of the Registrar strongly recommends that you review your academic record online, ie, update address, transfer credit from another institution. 
For undergraduate programs, those who were previously enrolled at UT Dallas, may return to the University by re-applying through Apply Texas. 
For graduate programs, complete and submit a re-entry form (PDF). All reentry requests for a semester must be received 10-days prior to the first day of the semester (full-term). If you have not attended UT Dallas in three long (fall and spring) semesters and you left UT Dallas on probationary status, you must apply for readmission.
I applied last semester, but I did not come to UT Dallas last semester. I really want to come to UT Dallas for this semester. What do I need to do?
You need to elect to defer your admission. To defer your admission, please complete and submit the deferment form located in Galaxy under Orion Self-Service, then, Admissions Forms Folder.
I have not attended UT Dallas in a long time (beyond a year). And, I was on probation status. What do I need to do?
You must be formally readmitted if you have not taken any classes for three long semesters (fall and spring).
To reapply for admission:
Domestic and International students must complete a new application for admission no later than the published deadline and pay an application fee. Incomplete applications or late applications will be required to register late and pay a late registration fee.
I would like to change my major. What do I need to do?
Eligible students wishing to change their major/plan/program should review the policy listed in the Academic Catalog.
How to Complete an “Incomplete”?
If you are completing work for a previous semester in which a grade of incomplete (I) was received (except thesis and dissertation courses), do not officially register for the course again. An incomplete course grade (grade of I) must be completed within the time period specified by the instructor, not to exceed eight weeks from the first day of the subsequent long semester. If the work is not completed within the limit, the grade will be changed to “F”. Once you have completed and submitted any outstanding work to the instructor, your grade will be brought to the Office of the Registrar by your instructor for processing. For more information see the appropriate catalog.
I am a non-degree student and would like to apply to degree seeking. I don’t want to lose all the credit that I took as non-degree seeking. What do I need to do?
No more than fifteen hours of applicable non-degree credit may be transferred to a degree program at the University. However, acceptance of credit is at the discretion of the Associate Dean or program head and the University Registrar.
How do I view my end-of-semester grades?

No, semester and midterm grades can be viewed in your UTD Student Center.
My name is not correct in the system. How do I go about changing it?
Primary Name
For information on changing names and addresses, please see the catalog.
Preferred Name
The University recognizes that many community members use names other than their primary/legal names to identify themselves. As long as the use of this different name is not for the purpose of misrepresentation, the University acknowledges that a preferred name may be used whenever possible in the course of university business and education.
The student is free to determine the preferred name they wish to be known by in the Orion student information system; however, inappropriate use of the preferred name policy may be cause for denying the request.
The student should send email from their UT Dallas email account to records@utdallas.edu to edit the preferred name.
Q: What is a preferred name? A: Preferred name is a first and or middle name that does not match your Primary/Legal name in the Orion student information system. Currently Preferred Name is defaulted to match the Primary/Legal Name in the Orion student information system.
Q: Where is preferred name displayed? A: In Orion, student preferred name is displayed in your Student Self-Service screen, and on Grade Rosters. The preferred name is also displayed on eLearning grade rosters and Comet Cards.
Q: Can I get a Comet Card issued with my preferred name? A: Yes, Comet Cards can be updated to have preferred name on front and legal name on the back.
Q: Can I get an official transcript, the commencement program, or my diploma issued with my preferred name? A: No, the official transcript, the commencement program, and diploma are issued only with the primary/legal name.
Q: I have more questions regarding preferred name, who can I contact? A: Please email your questions to records@utdallas.edu. A member of the Registrar’s Office staff will respond.

Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act
The “Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act” (also known as the Wetterling Act) is a federal law enacted on October 28, 2000 that provides for the tracking of convicted, registered sex offenders enrolled as students at institutions of higher education, or working or volunteering on campus.
This act amends the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 to clarify that nothing in that Act may be construed to prohibit an educational institution from disclosing information provided to the institution concerning registered sex offenders and requires the Secretary of Education to take appropriate steps to notify educational institutions that disclosure of this information is permitted. Information about registered sex offenders may be found on:

Neuroscientists have known since the 19th century that corresponding regions of the left and right hemispheres of the brain don’t always perform the same functions. Imaging studies have more recently documented this lateralization in the context of chronic pain, specifically in the amygdala, where emotional processing also occurs.
A team of researchers led by Dr. Benedict Kolber, associate professor of neuroscience in the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences at The University of Texas at Dallas, has demonstrated in mice that a single neuropeptide has opposite effects on chronic bladder pain when the molecule is active in matching regions of opposite hemispheres of the brain. The research was published in the Feb. 15 print issue of the journal Biological Psychiatry.

“This finding is particularly striking — it’s flip sides of the same coin,” said Kolber, who is corresponding author of the study and is affiliated with the Center for Advanced Pain Studies at UTD. “It’s bizarre. It speaks to the flexibility of natural systems. While in many cases there’s redundancy, there can also be specialization that evolves.”
Kolber’s team conducted its study on a mouse model of bladder pain. When the researchers introduced the protein calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) to the animals’ amygdalae, they found that CGRP administered in the right side increased behavioral signs of bladder pain, but when administered in the left side, it decreased painlike behavior in the bladder.
“There are other examples in the amygdala of situations in which one side has a specialized receptor that increases pain, and the other side doesn’t do anything. But none with counteractive effects like this,” Kolber said. “CGRP is driving pain on the right side and reducing pain on the left.”
Lead author Dr. Heather Allen, a UT Dallas visiting scholar and a postdoctoral associate at New York University, said that lateralization is often ignored in pain research.
“This finding is particularly striking — it’s flip sides of the same coin. It’s bizarre. It speaks to the flexibility of natural systems. While in many cases there’s redundancy, there can also be specialization that evolves.”
Dr. Benedict Kolber, associate professor of neuroscience in the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences
“Here, we demonstrate that bladder pain — visceral pain in a centrally located organ — is processed differently on the left and right sides of the brain,” she said. “If we had focused on only one side of the amygdala, we would have completely missed out on discovering these divergent functions.”
Kolber’s area of expertise is urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome, an umbrella term for varieties of pain that affect an estimated 10 million people in the U.S. each year, primarily middle-aged women.
“It’s a huge area of clinical need, and we don’t know how to treat it,” he said. “So while this is a broader story about lateralization, we’re also seeking specific answers. The patient is the priority — I want to understand this disease so it can be treated in humans.”

To learn more about how UT Dallas is enhancing lives through transformative research, explore New Dimensions: The Campaign for UT Dallas.
Kolber said there have probably been hundreds of studies that went unpublished by researchers who moved on because they assumed there was no difference between hemispheres. He said his group’s results could enable progress in research on other medical conditions, including stroke, depression, and some learning and memory phenomena.
“We’re discovering something about nature, something fundamental. That’s really exciting,” he said.
Allen said the next step is to identify the reason for the polar opposite behavior on matching sides of the brain in response to the same neuropeptide.
“We are currently investigating the signaling pathway from CGRP-positive cells in the amygdala to other parts of the brain to see if that provides any evidence,” she said. “We are also investigating these findings in other pain models to evaluate if this phenomenon is isolated to bladder pain or whether it extends to other types of pain.
“Chronic pain treatments are often ineffective largely because we still don’t truly understand the underlying mechanisms. Understanding these pain pathways will hopefully help us design effective therapeutics in the future.”
Additional contributors to the research include UT Dallas neuroscience research associate Dr. Lakeisha Lewter, and cognition and neuroscience doctoral student Veronica Hong, as well as researchers from the University of Pittsburgh and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
The work was supported by three NIH grants (F31DK121484, R01DK115478 and F32DK128969).

University of Texas at Dallas bioengineers have developed sensors that monitor multiple soil parameters, including total soil carbon, to provide farmers with accurate, real-time, continuous data to improve soil health and productivity.

“This is the equivalent of having a wearable health sensor on your body that tells you in real-time what’s happening. Think of it as a wearable for the soil,” said Dr. Shalini Prasad, department head of bioengineering and the Cecil H. and Ida Green Professor in Systems Biology Science in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science. “We are excited about the potential for our soil sensors to provide more accurate testing of living soil in its ecosystem.”
Prasad, who has developed wearable sensor technology to monitor various human health conditions such as diabetes, received research funding through a two-year UT Dallas Intellectual Property Assignment/Sponsored Research Agreement (IPA/SRA) to investigate the use of electrochemical methods to assess soil health for industry partner Soil in Formation (SIF), a public benefit corporation. In January, SIF sponsored additional research to advance the technology, including technology to capture additional soil parameters.
“This is the equivalent of having a wearable health sensor on your body that tells you in real-time what’s happening. Think of it as a wearable for the soil.”
Dr. Shalini Prasad, the Cecil H. and Ida Green Professor in Systems Biology Science in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science
Electrochemical soil testing involves applying electrical stimulation to the soil and measuring chemical reactions to the voltage. Prasad’s team described the testing of soil using electrochemical sensors in an article published June 29, 2022, in the Journal of The Electrochemical Society.
The method developed by UT Dallas researchers measures pH, moisture, volumetric bulk density and the two main soil carbon pools — levels of soil organic matter and carbonaceous soil minerals — as well as total soil carbon.
The Intellectual Property Assignment/
Sponsored Research Agreement (IPA/SRA) model at UT Dallas provides an industry sponsor the opportunity to own the intellectual property (IP) that results from a sponsor-funded research project. Giving the sponsor ownership of the IP upfront eliminates much of the risk and uncertainty around license negotiations and the subsequent financial obligations.
Prasad said the sensor represents a paradigm shift in soil testing. Typically, soil is tested by digging up a sample and sending it to a lab, or it is evaluated remotely by infrared methods or satellite. SIF wanted to develop a more direct and accurate method for testing soil as a dynamic, living ecosystem.
Henry Rowlands, the company’s research and development lead, said this new soil health monitoring technology developed by UTD researchers significantly improves the accuracy and auditability of soil test results.
“The sensors developed at UTD should provide data that farmers and other stakeholders can use to improve soil health and mitigate climate change by improving soil’s ability to draw down carbon from the atmosphere,” Rowlands said.
As soil quality declines from damaging agricultural practices, the technology could play a role in enabling the improvement of soil health on a global scale, which also could help address food insecurity, Rowlands said.

Three University of Texas at Dallas researchers who are developing innovative ways to help save people’s lives have received second-tier Baxter Young Investigator Awards for their work.
Bioengineering postdoctoral researcher Dr. Sasya Madhurantakam, biomedical engineering doctoral student Ivneet Banga and mechanical engineering research associate Dr. Qi Cai are the latest UT Dallas recipients of the award, which supports research to develop therapies and medical products that save and sustain patients’ lives. Ambalika Tanak MS’16, PhD’21 and Badrinath Jagannath PhD’21 were previous Baxter Award recipients from UTD, in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Medical technology company Baxter International Inc. named 17 winners of the award, which included six first-tier recipients. UT Dallas was the only institution with more than two awardees in 2022.

When Madhurantakam’s father-in-law in India came down with a mild case of COVID-19 in 2020, the family thought he was better off recovering at home. When he didn’t seem to recover, the family took him to the hospital, but within three days, he died.
Madhurantakam, who was conducting postdoctoral work in Japan and was not allowed to travel to India at the time, saw the medical problem very clearly: Caretakers and hospital staff had no way to tell which COVID-19 patients needed a high level of hospital care and who would recover at home.
She joined Dr. Shalini Prasad’s Biomedical Microdevices and Nanotechnology Laboratory at UT Dallas to develop a way to quickly detect the severity of a patient’s infection.
The method uses an electrochemical sensing technique originated by Prasad, department head of bioengineering and the Cecil H. and Ida Green Professor in Systems Biology Science.
Madhurantakam’s technology uses a blood sample to show whether a patient has COVID-19, and if so, the severity of the disease. The wallet-sized device senses the patient’s immune system response to COVID-19, with a strong response correlating to a more serious case of the disease.
Within minutes, the device can detect the levels of four kinds of biomarkers, even before a patient shows symptoms of infection.
“The development of a device that is useful to the community and society is the major contribution I can make,” said Madhurantakam, who also lost several other family members to COVID-19. “I don’t want to do research that is just limited to publications. I want to develop technologies that are useful to people.”

Banga also earned a Baxter Award for a disease detection device — a handheld breath analyzer — that can detect respiratory diseases, including COVID-19, within seconds.
“When COVID started, we were all sitting at home,” Banga said. “One day, Dr. Prasad asked whether we could design an electrochemical sensor for COVID.
“We were getting reports that COVID was affecting people’s lung capacity. I thought that might be a good starting point.”
“This breath analyzer platform is a first-of-its-kind screening tool for coronavirus detection in under five seconds,” said Banga, who previously was selected as one of two runners-up for a Young Chemist Award from laboratory equipment manufacturer Metrohm USA.
The device detects levels of volatile organic compounds in the breath that increase when a patient has COVID-19 or other respiratory infections.
Banga’s future work includes studying the device’s potential for detecting other serious diseases.
“It is exciting to see the great strides our doctoral students and early career researchers are making in developing cutting-edge technology that demonstrates promise in translating from bench to bedside or to homes,” Prasad said. “The nurturing and vibrant environment at UT Dallas plays a critical role in empowering these young minds to dream big for a global impact.”

Cai works with Dr. Zhenpeng Qin, associate professor of mechanical engineering and Fellow, Eugene McDermott Professor, and other researchers in his lab on developing a technique to temporarily open the blood-brain barrier to deliver medicine to the brain.
“On one side, this can help our brain be healthy, maintain normal function,” she said about the dynamic barrier that protects the brain. “On the other side, it prevents the drugs from getting into the brain.”
With Qin, Cai and her colleagues developed a method to temporarily prop open cells in the membrane using gold nanoparticles to allow medicine to enter. They showed that the approach is safe and doesn’t harm blood vessels or brain activity.
That means, for example, that cancer medication might be delivered into the brain to treat glioblastoma, a particularly deadly type of cancer due to the difficulty of getting medication past the brain’s barrier to the tumors.
“The prestigious Baxter Award is a coveted honor in the field of engineering and applied sciences, recognizing the scientific excellence, creativity and novelty, as well as addressing unmet scientific and technological needs,” Qin said. “Dr. Cai is clearly a rising star among her peers. Her outstanding background in nanomaterials and unwavering drive to tackle the most complex challenges in the realm of brain disorders are unparalleled.”
Cai also teamed up with Dr. Robert Bachoo, associate professor of neurology and internal medicine at UT Southwestern Medical Center, to establish two glioblastoma animal models that recapitulate the gene mutations and tumor microenvironment that are commonly seen in human glioblastoma. In animals, the treatment approach was shown to decrease tumor size and increase survival rates.
The promise of developing lab work into solutions for real people is what drew Cai to UT Dallas.
“I have a background in chemistry; I have a lot of experience in nanoparticles. But I always think, ‘What can I do with these things?’” she said. “I always wanted to solve a problem to help people.”

Are you a receptionist, or are you a director of first impressions? Although the job duties might be identical, that second title could cost you, University of Texas at Dallas and Harvard University researchers described in a new report.
According to the study, employees with inflated, managerial-sounding titles might be missing out on overtime pay — a practice that increases sharply right around the federal pay threshold that allows companies to avoid paying for overtime.
The research, published online by the National Bureau of Economic Research in January, was compiled by Naveen Jindal School of Management faculty members Dr. Umit Gurun, the Stan Liebowitz Professor of accounting and of finance and managerial economics, and Dr. Bugra Ozel, associate professor of accounting; and Dr. Lauren Cohen, professor of finance at Harvard Business School.

It’s all about the bottom line, Ozel said. Firms save $4 billion in overtime costs per year by inflating titles. For workers, however, the loss of overtime results in 13.5% less pay than they might earn as a nonsalaried employee.
And unfortunately, Ozel said, the fines companies pay when they are caught by federal regulators amount to far less than the savings they realize by misclassifying workers who should be paid overtime.
“That’s exactly the problem,” he said. “Companies do it because it’s beneficial for them. They do the calculation and realize that even if they get caught, it will still probably have been worth doing.”
Because the workers affected by these fake titles tend to make low wages, it’s hard for them to fight for their lost pay.
“It’s difficult for the employees — they’re probably losing $2,000 to $3,000 a year because of this. Is it worth hiring a lawyer and fighting the company for it? There has to be a mass of enough employees who are all suffering from this thing,” Ozel said.

Generally, nonsalaried workers are required to be paid one-and-a-half times their hourly wage for any time worked over 40 hours in a week. But a federal threshold for avoiding overtime pay for managers — first set in 1938 — has only rarely been increased, Ozel said.
The researchers found a systematic, robust and sharp increase in firms’ use of managerial titles around the federally set salary cap, which was $455 per week at the time the paper’s data set was collected.
Ozel and Gurun think the regulation is outdated.
“The regulation has changed very little, but the economy and conditions have changed a lot, and sometimes regulations do not keep up with the changing conditions. This is an example of that,” Ozel said.
Many of the “managerial” titles they identified are obviously questionable, such as “grooming manager” and “assistant bingo manager,” but the practice of inflating job names is incredibly common, Gurun said.
“In all sorts of industries, this one thing happens to be a trick on the laborers that corporations seem to be playing,” he said.
“It’s difficult for the employees — they’re probably losing $2,000 to $3,000 a year because of this.”
Dr. Bugra Ozel, associate professor of accounting in the Naveen Jindal School of Management
Based on numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Gurun said, only one out of 50 people should be classified as a manager.
“But around the salary threshold, you see this go up to three or four out of 50 people,” he said. “So you have to think, ‘Is there anything else going on here?’”
The proof appears to lie in the exceptions: The researchers observed no similar jumps in managerial titles around any other monetary threshold besides the one that regulates overtime pay.
In addition, the five states that have the tightest regulations around overtime pay showed no such spikes in managerial titles around the federal pay threshold.
The best solution is to change the federal regulation and simply pay people for time worked, regardless of title, Gurun said.
“We can easily see what time you clocked in and how much you performed. So it doesn’t matter what the title is. It doesn’t matter if you have a fictitious managerial title,” he said. “We should pay people for what they do, instead of who they are.”

Serife Tekin, PhD
Mental Disorders and the Multitudinous Self Model
Recent work in philosophy of psychiatry has drawn attention to the epistemic and ethical value of the inclusion of the first-person experience and reports of individuals with mental disorders in investigating the properties of mental disorders and designing effective interventions. In this talk, using insights from research, treatment, and patients’ testimonies, I develop a model of the self (Multitudinous Self Model) that showcases how first-person perspectives can be integrated to research and clinical treatment in psychiatry, and how they can be reconciled with the clinical and scientific perspectives.
Bio:
Serife Tekin is Associate Professor and Director of Medical Humanities at Department of Philosophy and Classics at The University of Texas at San Antonio. Her research in philosophy of psychiatry takes place at the cusp of feminist philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, artificial intelligence, and bioethics.

Kara Peak is a PhD student in the bioengineering department.
From North Texas, Kara is in the sixth and final year of her PhD program. After defending her dissertation, the last step in her journey to earn a PhD, Kara will become a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Minnesota. She currently works in Dr. Victor Varner’s lab within the bioengineering department, researching developmental biomechanics of lung airway branching morphogenesis, the process that causes an organism to develop its shape.
Before she came to UTD, Kara earned her undergraduate degree in chemical and biochemical engineering from the Colorado School of Mines.
In her time at UT Dallas, Kara has loved becoming involved with activism groups to affect positive change. She was heavily involved with the Graduate Student Assembly (GSA), which is the governing body for graduate students at UT Dallas that works to improve the grad-student experience.
Outside of her research, Kara likes to visit with friends and walk her 7.5-year-old rescue dog, Ruby, who helps her de-stress and get outside when she’s not at work.
Follow along to see Kara’s day and discover some of what UTD has to offer.

The safety and security of students and campus employees and visitors are essential components of a great experience at UT Dallas. The following departments have primary responsibility for the safety of the campus community:
The University’s Police Department patrols campus 24 hours a day, every day of the year. The department serves the UT Dallas community with a mix of commissioned officers and public safety individuals. The UT Dallas Police maintain a close relationship with public safety teams for the city of Richardson, including its police, fire and emergency management departments. The city of Richardson Fire Department responds to incidents on campus and works with our fire marshal to monitor facilities for fire prevention.
The Emergency Management team coordinates a comprehensive, all-hazards approach through all cycles of an emergency — preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation.
The Office of Institutional Risk & Safety Programs ensures the campus community has the tools needed to make active safety choices and minimize risks in UT Dallas’ research areas, academic programs, operational and administrative units, student affairs, campus events and neighborhood environment.
Student volunteers with University Emergency Medical Response serve as around-the-clock first responders to provide fast, direct Basic Life Support and first aid on campus.
Alert systems throughout campus supplement safety efforts. An outdoor siren system warns residents of severe weather or other hazards approaching the area. The system typically is tested on the first Wednesday of each month. Indoor voice alert systems are in place in most academic facilities and in the residence halls. The UT Dallas community and guests are encouraged to help keep the campus safe by taking the same precautions for personal safety and belongings you would take elsewhere:
Plan now to stay informed in an emergency. In emergencies, traditional communications systems can be overwhelmed. Our homepage is always the most authoritative source of information in emergencies. But if it should be rendered inaccessible, UT Dallas offers alternative communication channels you should make note of now, before the need arises. How to stay informed:
In case of emergency, you can ease communication by doing the following:
The WeatherSTEM station on campus provides a micro-local forecast and current weather information for the University.
An Ohio State University video provides advice for surviving an active shooter event on a college campus. This video contains graphic reenactments that may be disturbing to some.

Senate Bill 11 (SB 11), also known as “campus carry,” permits handgun license holders to carry their weapons onto the campus and into the general buildings of public universities and colleges in Texas. Passed by the 84th Texas Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott, SB 11 took effect Aug. 1, 2016. As part of the law, the University was allowed to establish reasonable rules, regulations or other provisions regarding the carrying of concealed handguns, including campus locations where concealed carry is prohibited, subject to amendment by the UT System Board of Regents. The purpose of the UT Dallas policy is to comply with the law while maintaining the maximum safety and security of UT Dallas students, staff, faculty and guests.
In accordance with SB 11, signs will be posted on entry points of buildings deemed exclusion zones, where concealed carry is prohibited. In addition to the Center for Vital Longevity, the entire facilities of the Center for BrainHealth and the Callier Center campus in Dallas, the highlighted buildings have been designated as exclusion zones.
If you have comments or concerns, please email us.

To reduce the public spread of COVID-19, your Title IX team is currently operating remotely. Please visit UTD’s COVID-19 updates page.
The University of Texas at Dallas is committed to maintaining a learning and working environment that is free from discrimination and harassment based on sex in accordance with federal and state laws, including Title IX of the Higher Education Amendments of 1972, a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs or activities.
UT Dallas’s Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibits all forms of sex-based discrimination and sexual misconduct, including sexual harassment, sexual violence, sexual assault, stalking, domestic violence and/or dating violence. The University’s commitment to equal opportunity extends its nondiscrimination protections to include sexual orientation, gender expression, and gender identity. Retaliation against any individual who submits a report, files a complaint, or otherwise participates in the investigation or disciplinary process under the policy is prohibited.
For information regarding the disciplinary process that may occur after an investigation is completed, see the policy applicable to the respondent: the Student Code of Conduct, Discipline and Dismissal of Classified Employees Policy, or University Policy on Faculty Conduct.
It’s On Us is a campaign launched in 2014 by the White House Council on Women and Girls, the Department of Health and Human Services Office on Women’s Health, and the Center for American Progress. It’s On Us seeks to reframe the conversation surrounding sexual assault in a way that inspires everyone to see it as his or her responsibility to do something, big or small, to prevent it.
Thousands of UT Dallas students have taken the pledge to do their part to create a culture of consent, bystander intervention, and survivor support.

Your identity will remain confidential. You have the option to submit a report anonymously; however, the
          Office of Community Standards and Conduct may be limited in completing the investigation and taking
          disciplinary action without the ability to thoroughly investigate by contacting you as the reporting party.
The 70th Texas Legislature enacted a law concerning hazing. Under the law, individuals or organizations
          engaging in hazing could be subject to fines and charged with a criminal offense.
According to the law, a person can commit a hazing offense not only by engaging in a hazing activity, but
          also by soliciting, directing, encouraging, aiding or attempting to aid another in hazing; by intentionally,
          knowingly or recklessly allowing hazing to occur; or by failing to report, in writing to the Dean of Students
          or another appropriate official of the institution, first-hand knowledge that a hazing incident is planned or
          has occurred. The fact that a person consented to or acquiesced in a hazing activity is not a defense to
          prosecution for hazing under this law.
In an effort to encourage reporting of hazing incidents, the law grants immunity from civil or criminal
          liability to any person who reports a specific hazing event in good faith and without malice to the Dean of
          Students or other appropriate official of the institution and immunizes that person for participation in any
          judicial proceeding resulting from liability that might otherwise be incurred or imposed as a result of the
          report. The penalty for failure to report is a fine of up to $1,000, up to 180 days in jail, or both.
          Penalties for other hazing offenses vary according to the severity of the injury which results and include
          fines from $500 to $10,000 and/or confinement for up to two years.
The law defines hazing as: any intentional, knowing or reckless act, occurring on or off the campus
            of an educational institution, by one person alone or acting with others, directed against a student, that
            endangers the mental or physical health or safety of a student for the purpose of pledging, being initiated
            into, affiliating with, holding office in or maintaining membership in any organization whose members are
            or include students at an educational institution.
Hazing includes but is not limited to:
This law does not affect or in any way limit the right of the university to enforce its own rules against
          hazing under UTDSP5003, Student Code of Conduct.
Activities which under certain conditions constitute acts which are dangerous, harmful or degrading, in
          violation of University rules include, but are not limited to:
In accordance with requirements of the Texas Education Code, Section 51.936(c), the following
          organizations have been disciplined for hazing and/or convicted for hazing, on or off campus, during the
          preceding three years.

The Multicultural Center developed this land acknowledgement via extensive research into the Indigenous histories of the land where UT Dallas now sits.
The Caddo Confederacy stretched from North Texas to the Red River, and east to what is now known as Louisiana, and into southern Arkansas. The Caddo people were the leaders of the Caddo Nation, an organized Confederacy of at least 25 smaller tribes. The Confederacy was active until the 1800’s and numbered 250,000 at the height of their existence. The Spanish explorers of the 1600’s referred to Caddo’s as “the great kingdom of Tejas” and called this area “the land of the Tejas.” The Caddo Confederacy was often referred to by the Spanish as “the Tejas.” The Hasinais were among the 25 tribes of the Caddo Confederacy and “Tejas” is the Spanish translation of the Hasinais word Tayshas, “Those who are friends.”
The Caddo people were the original founders and stewards of this land and were the true original Texans. The history of Texas begins with the Caddo Confederacy and Indigenous people.
In 1961, Eugene McDermott, J. Erik Jonsson, and Cecil Green established the Graduate Research Center of the Southwest (GRCSW). The construction of the Founders Building, the new home of the GRCSW, began in 1963 and was completed the next year. In 1967, the GRCSW’s name was changed to the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies (SCAS). In September 1969, the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies joined the UT System and became The University of Texas at Dallas.
The Founders Building, which housed the GRCSW, was built on 191 acres of farmland owned by F.M. and E.T. Armstrong. When UT Dallas joined the UT System in 1969, the 191 acres of farmland from the Armstrong family, along with farmland from C.M. Walton (120 acres) and J.R. Black (160 acres) was included as part of the purchase agreement. In 1972, 275 acres of land was donated to UT Dallas by the Hoblitzelle Foundation to UT Dallas for a total of 746 acres or 1.16 square miles. The original road from the Founders Building to Campbell Road was named Armstrong Drive, of which a small remnant is still located between University Parkway and North Loop Rd. Many locals believed that Armstrong Drive was named after the American astronaut Neil Armstrong. This was a common myth based on the belief that research was being conducted by the SCAS in partnership with the NASA Apollo program of the late 1960s. This was not true, but it sure sounded good.
Prior to the establishment of the GRCSW, this area was primarily family-owned agricultural farmland and was often referred to as the Blackland Prairie. Farmlands were typically family owned and would have been primarily for personal livelihood and local trade. Wheat and cotton were grown seasonally in rotation along with other agricultural crops. Farms also included animals, such as horses, sheep, chickens, and cattle. These farmlands were the foundation and an integral part of the growth of the city of Richardson and Collin County.
Little is known about the Armstrong farmland, such as the crops, animals and when it was originally established. However, it would have resembled the adjacent Farrell farmland. The Farrell farmland was located on the north side of the Armstrong farmland. Established in 1891, the 365-acre farmstead was a sizable wheat farm owned by Hunter and Mary Farrell. The Farrells divorced in 1928 and Mary then took ownership until turning the farm over to her daughter Ammie, who ran the farm until 1972. “Miss Ammie” was known as a champion sheep breeder. After her passing, the main farmhouse was converted to the Plano Heritage Farmstead Museum located on 15th Street, east of Custer Road. The Farrell and Armstrong families would have been direct descendants of the Peters Colony established in the 1840s.
Immediately north of the Farrell farmstead was the Haggard farmland which is currently located at Custer Road and Park Boulevard in Plano, Texas. The Haggard farmstead, established in 1884, would have been adjacent to the north end of the Farrell farmstead. Originally, the Haggard farm was a very large wheat and cotton farm and is still an operational wheat farm today. However, much of the land has since been sold or donated to the City of Plano. The Haggard name can be found on current Plano public buildings, roads, parks, and schools. Today, you can drive by the farm and see the llamas that were originally brought in to protect the sheep herds from coyotes. In 2021 the City of Plano approved a controversial mixed-use development on 46 acres of some of the last undeveloped Haggard farmland near Dallas North Tollway between Spring Creek Parkway and Parkwood Boulevard. The developer designated to build the project is Rutledge Haggard of the Haggard family. The Haggard farmlands and family are direct descendants of the Peters Colony established in the 1840’s.
To fully understand the history of the land in this area, it’s important to understand the “empresario land grants.” The grants were established by European investors as a strategy for colonization of other countries during the 1800s.
Empresario land grants were business contracts first given by Spain, continued by Mexico and then by the Texas Republic. Spain created the land grants as a means of colonizing this area. When Mexico claimed independence from Spain, they continued the practice as a means of settling the northern area of Mexico. When the Republic of Texas was established, the practice continued to enable the settlement of the North Texas region. As part of the empresario agreement or contract, Mexico required each “empresario” to claim Mexican citizenship, adopt Catholicism, and agree to settle a specific number of Catholic families on a defined land grant. The financial backing for these grants were typically made by European investors based in London, England.
To summarize as an example: In 1821, Stephen F. Austin was allotted 67,000 acres by the Mexican government to settle in the Northern area of Mexico near the Brazos River. He then recruited the first 300 families, mostly Europeans from United States, and distributed to each family individual parcels of land to settle. In turn the families paid a fee to Austin for the land use. Many Texas history narratives will often state that Stephen F. Austin moved to Texas. The true story is he moved to Mexico and became a Mexican citizen. The first 300 families also moved to Mexico becoming Mexican citizens. Texas, as a state or republic, did not exist in 1821; the area at the time was often referred to as “Indian territory” claimed by Mexico.     
To clarify, the term “to settle” can also be interchanged with the term “to occupy,” depending on the perspective of the people involved and the narrative that is written.
One of the central objectives of this project was to research the use and ownership of the enslaved and connection of the institution of slavery to the land, the development of the land, and the university. In 1865, there was an estimated 250,000 slaves in Texas, approximately 35% of the state’s population. Slave plantations were predominately located in South and East Texas primarily for cotton and wheat production. There are many well-written accounts discussing plantations, slavery, and the connections of the enslaved to the colonization of Texas. However, for the purposes of this narrative, the research showed that the Austin Colony was fully engaged in the slave trade and were owners of the enslaved including Stephen F. Austin. The research did not find any connection of the institution of slavery or the enslaved among the Peters Colony or to UT Dallas.
William Peters, prior to moving to the North Texas region, owned and operated a music store in Louisville, Kentucky. In 1840, William was granted an empresario grant from the Republic of Texas. He started the Peters Colony which eventually led to the distribution of over 880,000 acres of North Texas free land to over 2,200 families. Thirteen times the amount of free land given to the Austin Colony. The first of these families from the Peters Colony settled in the Breckenridge area. The main town center was located on land that is now occupied by the Dallas College Richland Campus. The Armstrong, Haggard, and Farrell families were descendants of the early European settlers that came to this North Texas region as part of the Peters Colony land grant. The original families that occupied this area were part of the Peters Colony and were the founders of the City of Richardson, Plano, McKinney, Allen and most, if not all, of the cities in the current North Texas region. The city of the Colony is named in honor of the Peters Colony.
Prior to and during the arrival of the Peters Colony, the land that UT Dallas currently occupies was commonly known as Indian territory and fully settled by the Caddo people. Anthropologist have dated the Caddo’s historical origins back to 800 A.D. The Spanish explorers of the 1600’s referred to Caddo’s as “the great kingdom of Tejas” and called this area “the land of the Tejas.” The Caddo Confederacy was often referred to by the Spanish as the Tejas. The Hasinais were among the 25 tribes of the Caddo Confederacy and “Tejas” is the Spanish translation of the Hasinais word Tayshas, “Those who are friends.”
The Caddo Confederacy stretched from North Texas to the Red River, and east to what is now known as Louisiana, and into southern Arkansas. The Caddo people were the leaders of the Caddo Nation, an organized Confederacy of at least 25 smaller tribes. The Confederacy was active until the 1800’s and numbered 250,000 at the height of their existence.
The Caddo communities were complex and socially ranked societies with well-planned civic-ceremonial centers They conducted elaborate mortuary rituals and ceremonial practices and engaged in extensive interregional trade. Their community centers had earthen mounds used as platforms for temple structures for civic and religious functions, for burials of the social and political elite, and for ceremonial fire mounds. An example of these ceremonial mounds can be found in the town center of the city currently known as Flower Mound. This mound was created by the neighboring Wichita tribe. Some believe that Wichita tribal leaders are still buried within this sacred mound.
Once Texas became part of the United States in 1846, the state capitalized on the ability to use U.S. federal troops to act on and enforce the 1830 U.S. Indian Removal Act. In 1855 the Caddo people, along with all Indigenous tribes, were forcibly removed and relocated to the newly created Brazos Indian Reservation. This area is located 140 miles west of Richardson in an area currently known as Newcastle, Texas, adjacent to the Brazos River and Fort Belknap. In 1859, the Indigenous tribes were again forcibly removed and relocated to the Washita River in Indian Territory in what is currently Caddo County, Oklahoma. The Caddo Nation of Oklahoma is a federally recognized tribe located in Binger, Oklahoma, and are descendants of the historic Caddo tribes.
It’s important to note that the government of Texas, with support of white settlers, and the U.S. government, took these violent removal actions soon after Texas signed three significant peace treaties with the Indigenous tribal leaders. The 1843 Treaty of Bird’s Fort, located in what is currently Arlington, Texas, the 1844 Treaty of Tehuacana Creek, and the 1847 Treaty of Meusebach-Comanche. These violent actions, starting in 1855, were taken for the removal of the all the Indigenous people of Texas for the purpose of seizing the land to make room for the continued colonization, expansion, and distribution of free land to the families of 1840s Peters Colony.
The Caddo people were the original founders and stewards of this land and were the true original Texans. The history of Texas begins with the Caddo Confederacy and Indigenous people.
“I am here only the representative of the Caddos – My people live with the Wichitas, the Lonies, Anadarkoes, Tawaconies, Kechies and Southern Delawares. Each one of these tribes once had a country and homes of their own. Each tribe once had a country where their ancestors had lived for generations and to which they were attached by ties and associations as sacred and dear as those that cluster in the memories and inspire the hearts of the white man for his country and home. We have none now…The story of our wrongs and sufferings is too long to be told you now – I will not attempt it.”– Chief White Bread, Chief of the Caddo, 1888
I would like to recognize the following for their contribution and support in the development of these materials. There were many conversations with numerous people on and off campus throughout the process of writing this narrative; the people listed were especially crucial to the progress of this project.

The Cherokee Indians had settled in the lands north of San Antonio since 1819. This treaty was primarily about land, boundaries, and trade. The Parties declare that there shall be a firm and lasting peace forever, and that a friendly intercourse shall be preserved, by the people belonging to both parties. The Parties to this Treaty agree that one or more agencies, shall be created and at least one agent shall reside, specially, within the Cherokee Villages, whose duty it shall be to see, that no injustice is done to them, or other members of the community of Indians. The Republic of Texas Senate rejected the treaty, saying that the Consultation had exceeded its powers by confirming the Cherokee land grants.
This treaty was signed at Bird’s Fort on the Arkikosa River, now called the Trinity River, near present day Arlington. The treaty was intended to end years of hostilities and warfare between the Native Americans and the white settlers in Texas. A treaty of peace and friendship between the Republic of Texas and the Delaware, Chickasaw, Waco, Tawakoni, Keechi, Caddo, Anadahkah, Ionie, Biloxi, and Cherokee tribes of Indians.
Signed at Tehuacana Creek in McLennan County near the area currently known as Waco, Texas.
Native Americans and Texans agreed to cease all hostilities and establish more cooperative political and commercial ties. A Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Commerce, between the Republic of Texas, and the Comanche, Keechie, Waco, Caddo, Anadakah, Ionie, Delaware, Shawnee, Cherokee, Lipan, and Tawakoni tribes of Indians, was concluded and signed at Tehuacana Creek.
Signed with the Comanche chiefs on the lower San Saba River and the area currently known as Fredericksburg, Texas. The treaty allowed Meusebach’s settlers to go unharmed into Indian territory and the Indians to go to the White settlements; promised mutual reports on wrongdoing; and provided for survey of lands in the San Saba area with a payment of at least $1,000 to the Indians. The treaty opened more than 3 million acres of land to settlement.
The Indian Civilization Act of 1819 was passed to encourage benevolent societies to provide education for the Indian tribes and provided the authorization to encourage the civilization programs. The act led to the formation of 52 schools over the next decade which were administered either by the federal government or by Christian missions.
The Indian Removal Act of 1830 freed more than 25 million acres of fertile, lucrative farmland to mostly white settlement in Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas. More than 46,000 Native Americans were forced—sometimes by the U.S. military—to abandon their homes and relocate to “Indian Territory” that eventually became the state of Oklahoma. This large movement is often referred to as “The Trail of Tears.”
The Indian Appropriations Act of 1841 allocated funds to move Western tribes onto Indian reservations where they would be protected and enclosed by the United States government. According to the federal government at that time, reservations were to be created in order to protect the Indians from increasing numbers of White Americans moving to the West. This act set the precedent for modern-day Indian reservations.
The Homestead Act of 1862 accelerated the settlement of the western territory by granting adult heads of families 160 acres of surveyed public land for a minimal filing fee and five years of continuous residence on that land. Most of the land went to speculators, cattle owners, miners, loggers, and railroads. Of some 500 million acres dispersed by the General Land Office between 1862 and 1904, only 80 million acres went to homesteaders.
The Indian Appropriation Act of 1871 stated that no longer was any group of Indians in the United States recognized as an independent nation by the federal government. Moreover, Congress directed that all Indians should be treated as individuals and legally designated “wards” of the federal government. Thus, this bill made it significantly easier for the federal government to secure lands that were previously owned by Native Americans.
The Indian Appropriations Act of 1885 Act allowed Indian tribes and individual Indians to sell unoccupied lands that they claimed to be their own.
The General Allotment Act of 1887 authorized the President to break up reservation land, which was held in common by the members of a tribe, into small allotments to be parceled out to individuals. The Act was the continuation effort to turn Native Americans into farmers, instead of hunters and traders. The land allotted to individuals included desert or near-desert lands unsuitable for farming. In addition, the techniques of self-sufficient farming were much different from their tribal way of life. The Dawes Act had a disastrous effect on many tribes, destroying traditional culture and society as well as causing the loss of as much as two-thirds of tribal land.
The Indian Appropriations Act of 1889 Act officially opened the Unassigned Lands to white settlers under tenets of the Homestead Act.
The Snyder Act of 1921 authorized funds for “the relief of distress and conservation of health” among American Indians. The act defines the government’s responsibility for American Indian health care and is one of several legislative reforms in the works to improve the living conditions for American Indians on reservations and in government boarding schools.
The Indian Reorganization Act conserved and developed Indian lands and resources; to extend to Indians the right to form business and, other organizations; to establish a credit system for Indians; to grant certain rights of home rule to Indians; to provide for vocational education for Indians; and for other purposes. The Act intended to reverse the assimilationist policies that had resulted in considerable damage to American Indian cultures, and to provide a means for American Indians to re-establish sovereignty and self-government, to reduce the losses of reservation lands, and to build economic self-sufficiency.
The Indian Termination Act of 1953 eliminated much government support for Indian tribes, including health care and social services, and ended the protected trust status of all Indian-owned lands. The U.S. government’s efforts to assimilate American Indians into mainstream culture can be seen throughout the 20th century in the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) activities.
The Indian Relocation Act of 1956 was the impetus for the relocation of the large number of Native Americans now living in urban areas. Though the act didn’t force people to leave their reservations, it made it hard for families to stay by dissolving federal recognition of most tribes, and ending federal funding for reservations’ schools, hospitals, and basic services, along with the jobs they created. The federal government paid for relocation expenses to the cities, and provided some vocational training.
The Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976 amended the Social Security Act to permit reimbursement by Medicare and Medicaid for services provided to American Indians and Alaska Natives in Indian Health Service (IHS) and tribal health care facilities. In doing so, Congress recognized that many Indian people, especially those residing in very remote and rural locations, were eligible for but could not access Medicaid and Medicare services without traveling sometimes hundreds of miles to Medicaid and Medicare providers located off reservation.
This page is a work in progress. For the purpose of the information contained in this webpage, “Native American” is used as an umbrella term. The terms “American Indian,” “Indigenous,” or tribal names are also included to provide context or in reference to terms as they were written historically in our resources. “American Indian” is the term officially used by the University as of June 2022.

Engaging in hazing, submitting to hazing, or failing to report first-hand knowledge of hazing incidents are prohibited by state law.
Hazing is defined by Texas State law (Texas Education Code, Chapter 37:
Subchapter F: Hazing) as: "any intentional, knowing, or reckless act, occurring on or off the campus of an educational institution, by one person alone or acting with others, directed against a student for the purpose of pledging, being initiated into, affiliating with, holding office in, or maintaining membership in an organization if the act:
The above includes hazing that is with or without the consent of participants. The University charges each student with notice and knowledge of full Texas State laws regarding hazing which can be found in Texas Statute Title 2, Subtitle G, Chapter 37, Subchapter F.  Any person with knowledge that a specific hazing incident has occurred on or off campus must immediately report the incident to the Dean.
Subsection 11: Immunity
If there is a more specific policy that specifies the proceedings for investigation, such as the Sexual Misconduct policy [UTDBP3102], that policy will govern; however, all the powers provided herein to the Dean for investigations involving student witnesses, including summons, interim disciplinary action, and withholding transcripts, grades, and degrees may be delegated to the investigator designated to that policy.

Individual faculty or staff members are encouraged to provide a first-level response to problem student behavior, unless the behavior is threatening or warrants more serious attention by the university. Experience indicates that, despite the common fear that responding to problem behaviors will escalate the trouble, the opposite is usually true. Students often express gratitude when faculty members respond effectively to problem behaviors. However, it is important to know one's own limitations in providing assistance to students. To learn more, refer to the following resources:
Often the best response is to listen carefully and then to encourage the student to seek help at the Student Counseling Center. You may call the center for a consultation if you are unsure of an appropriate intervention or if the student is reluctant to accept your referral. The following indicators may be useful in assessing whether or not a referral should be made.
Disruptive behavior: An individual student exhibiting inappropriate behavior should be approached in a private conversation that includes a description of the problem behavior and the specific consequences.
Stating a need for help: If a student comes to a faculty/staff member with a direct request for help, that student probably will value a recommendation for a referral to a professional.
Talking about suicide: If a student talks or writes about suicide, this should be taken seriously. If the student includes actual plans for suicide, the severity of the danger to the student increases dramatically. Suicide is often considered an option when the person feels hopeless, trapped, out of control or depressed. To make the assumption that talk of suicide is aimed solely toward getting attention can be a potentially fatal mistake. If you become aware of a student who is considering suicide, please make an immediate referral to the Counseling Center.
Observable changes: Some students do not state directly that there is a problem, but their behaviors can be telling indicators. Distinct changes in academic performance, withdrawal from others, changes in class participation, crying, outbursts of anger, increased or decreased activity, and poor attendance are examples of significant behavioral changes. Any of these observable changes may merit a referral to the Counseling Center.
Physical complaints: Students who repeatedly report physical illness or symptoms may be experiencing psychological problems. A change in eating patterns, sleep disturbances, fatigue, stomach aches, and pain are some common complaints that may be related to psychological problem.
Alcohol and drug abuse: Coming to class or a meeting when intoxicated or high is a serious signal. Often people drink or take drugs as a way to cope with and alleviate other problems in their life. Unfortunately, the substance abuse itself may become a problem that interferes with social, academic, and work functioning.
Academic problems: Students who have a noticeable decline in their academic performance may be feeling overwhelmed with other areas of their lives. Some students come to classes with difficulty concentrating, completing assignments, or performing well on exams.
The Behavior Assessment and Intervention Team (BAIT) reviews behavioral incidents and ensures a systematic response to students whose behavior may be disruptive or harmful to themselves or the UT Dallas community. The team assists in protecting the health, safety, and welfare of students and other members of the UT Dallas community.

In 2018, The University of Texas at Dallas submitted its newest Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP)—titled New Transfer Student Success—to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), our regional accreditor, as part of the reaffirmation of accreditation process.
Our QEP is an ambitious, multi-year project aimed at enhancing transfer support services across campus and ensuring that all new transfer students are engaged and feel a sense of belonging at UT Dallas. It is the culmination of a years-long effort to gather institutional data, analyze student outcomes, improve support programs and services, and equip our students to succeed both in and out of classrooms.
UT Dallas’ overarching mission, as stated in our Strategic Plan, is to graduate well-rounded citizens whose education has prepared them for rewarding lives and productive careers in a constantly changing world. New Transfer Student Success is one of the many ways that we’re working to make that vision a reality.
To retain our status as a public research university—and to remain in good standing with SACSCOC—UT Dallas must undergo a decennial reaffirmation of accreditation process, which typically takes 2-3 years to complete. This comprehensive review of all university operations ensures that UT Dallas adheres to the highest possible institutional standards. The QEP is an integral part of this process, a symbol of our ongoing commitment to upholding the principles and best practices established by SACSCOC.
But our QEP represents more than the mere fulfillment of SACSCOC policy. It is our promise to both current and future students--and to residents across the state of Texas--that we will pursue excellence in education and research by continuously striving to improve student learning outcomes, to enhance curricular and co-curricular supports across campus, and to help all students learn, grow, and thrive during their time at UT Dallas.
With a QEP focused on transfer student success--and with the inauguration of our new Office of Community College Relations--we are committed to developing stronger partnerships with two- and four-year institutions across North Texas and beyond and transforming UT Dallas into one of the state’s most transfer-ready universities.
Situated in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex—and in close proximity to two large community college systems (Collin College and Dallas College)—our university has been a go-to destination for transfer students interested in a top-tier baccalaureate education.
Transfer students make up more than 32% of our current undergraduate population. Ranging in age from 17 to 74, they arrive at UT Dallas with diverse experiences and educational backgrounds. We have exemplary transfer student retention rates--according to the most recent data, approximately 81% of our students persist from year one to year two--but we know that students who transfer between institutions often face a variety of challenges as they acclimate to new academic and social environments. Although 48% of our transfer students are 22 years old and younger, thus similar in age to “traditional” first-time-in-college students, some of our students have reported that they’ve struggled to meet like-minded peers, establish a healthy school-work-life balance, or connect to our campus community.
New Transfer Student Success (NTSS) creates a framework for helping new transfer students overcome these challenges, feel a sense of belonging on campus, and develop the skills they’ll need to succeed at UT Dallas and in their chosen career paths.
Developed with the most current student success research in mind—with a particular focus on sense of belonging and student engagement—NTSS aims to boost student learning outcomes, and thus both retention and graduation rates, by encouraging new transfer students to participate in what George Kuh, Vincent Tinto, and others refer to as “high-impact practices.” Of the many such practices in place at UT Dallas, NTSS is designed to enhance two in particular: peer mentoring and first-year experiences.
Aiming to help new students adjust to campus, we’ve developed an innovative peer mentoring program that matches transfer students with more advanced transfer student mentors who can provide support, encouragement, and helpful advice during that crucial first year on campus.
We believe that new students will benefit from close contact with an experienced peer who has already successfully navigated the transfer process. Our goal, as we work to expand the program, is to eventually provide meaningful mentoring opportunities for all interested incoming transfer students.
We are also working to increase new transfer students’ face-to-face interactions with their peers, as well as with UT Dallas faculty and staff, through the creation of enhanced transfer orientation programming. In consultation with current transfer students and key faculty and administrative stakeholders, we’ve spearheaded efforts to enhance the orientation experience for new transfer students so that they can better develop meaningful connections with peers and student groups, take advantage of university supports, and excel in their chosen fields of study.
Alongside these initiatives, we’ve gathered a cross-campus group of stakeholders to redesign our transfer equivalency tool, which will make it easier for prospective students and student advisors to evaluate transfer credits and thus make the best decisions possible when it comes to major and course selection. We’re also developing a new transfer services website that will co-locate information that’s currently found across several different web environments, making it easier for students to find key information before, during, and after they enroll at UT Dallas.
Although these projects are not formal QEP initiatives, they are led by the QEP stakeholder team and play an important role in making UT Dallas a more transfer-ready institution.
We know that students face a variety of obstacles when they transfer from one institution to another. NTSS is an integral part of our ongoing institutional efforts to simplify the transfer process and improve transfer student success.
From its founding in 1969 as a small, private institute for graduate students, UT Dallas has grown to become one of the nation’s preeminent public research institutions. Recognized in 2015 as a top-tier Research I university by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education—and propelled in part by the rapid economic growth of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex—we are the fourth-fastest-growing university in the United States. Exciting as this is, such explosive growth carries with it new challenges for our institution as we work to maintain exceptional educational standards for a growing and diverse student body.
Beginning in 2015, we initiated the reaffirmation of accreditation by soliciting ideas for our next Quality Enhancement Plan. We analyzed best practices at top-tier universities across the nation, and we invited faculty, staff, and students to serve on numerous QEP-related committees. We also solicited detailed proposals from stakeholders across campus and carried out a robust analysis of institutional data and student development research.
After a thorough review of all available information, we realized that the most effective QEP would be one that enhanced high-impact programs for first-year students. With this in mind, we took a holistic view of the first-year experience and developed an initiative known as Orbit: Keeping New Comets on Course that aimed to improve support services for all new UT Dallas students: first-time-in-college students, transfer students, international students, and graduate students. We also created a group called the New Student Engagement Board, made up of stakeholders across campus who oversee new student programming and coordinate campus-wide student support efforts.
But as we examined the scope of Orbit--and as we worked in consultation with SACSCOC reviewers to refine our QEP--we came to believe that one student group in particular would benefit from enhanced support services as well as the development of new high-impact programs: transfer students.
Aiming to deepen transfer students’ sense of belonging at UT Dallas—which we define as their sense of purpose and agency to achieve educational, personal, and professional goals as they recognize that they are respected, valued, and included in all aspects of the campus environment—we retained the overarching Orbit initiative while narrowing our QEP to focus on improving the new student experience for all UT Dallas transfer students.
Submitted to SACSCOC in 2018, New Transfer Student Success represents our ongoing efforts to develop high-impact, first-year programs, to enhance curricular and co-curricular supports, and to help new transfer students connect with members of our campus community and feel a sense of belonging to UT Dallas.
We’ve made strategic adjustments to our QEP since we submitted it to SACSCOC, prompted by institutional developments and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes will be detailed in our 5th year report.
If you would like to read our Quality Enhancement Plan—or find out more about the selection and development of the QEP—please check out the following resources:
The Gateways to Excellence in Math and Science (GEMS) Quality Enhancement Plan was designed to improve student learning outcomes in “gateway” math and science courses, specifically chemistry and calculus. Our QEP led to a curriculum redesign in various math and science courses to ensure students were achieving learning outcomes and to establish new methods of learning enhancement, such as peer and electronic instruction outside of classes. The QEP culminated in the creation of the Student Success Center, which provides all UT Dallas students with academic coaching, tutoring, peer-led team learning, and other instructional supports.

We track our success through the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability
 in Higher Education’s
 (AASHE [Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education] )
 Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System
 (STARS [Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System] ).
 It is an international standard for sustainability in higher education.
The STARS [Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System] 
 framework measures sustainability across all aspects of higher education in four broad
 categories: academics, engagement, operations, and planning and administration.
 Within these four categories, UT Dallas measures 63 credits and provides over
 1,000 data points in order to holistically assess sustainability. Sustainability
 efforts are quantified by STARS as points and are awarded in each credit category
 according to performance. Depending on the number of points accumulated, a university
 earns certification as a Reporter, Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum institution.
The Office of Sustainability has embraced the international standard for sustainability
 provided by the 
AASHE [Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education] 
STARS [Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System] 
 report and has adopted a mission statement to collaborate with stakeholders to
 integrate sustainability into the fabric of UT Dallas impacting academics, engagement,
 operations, and planning and administration. For this reason, the Office of
 Sustainability is pleased to announce that The University of Texas at Dallas
 has achieved STARS Gold status.
To commemorate this achievement along with The University of Texas at Dallas’
 50th anniversary, The Office of Sustainability has released The
 University’s first holistic Sustainability Report. Learn More >

ERG Brochure 2021 (pdf)
To create value by attracting, developing and retaining faculty, staff and students from diverse demographic groups, while providing educational awareness, professional development and enrichment to the UT Dallas culture. ERGs are the best resource for the next generation of leaders and diverse talent.
ERGs are comprised of a group of employees who are linked by social factors such as culture, gender, sexual orientation, or a common interest or goal within an organization.
Characteristics of an ERG are (but not limited to) the following:
UT Dallas Employee Resource Groups will help bring together individuals from shared backgrounds and provide a resource at work to help their members develop personally and professionally.
Employee Resource Groups can be beneficial to the culture within an organization and its bottom line. Many of these groups often start because of an employee’s need to network with other employees with similar interests and needs. Many of these groups quickly become a service model for the institution in the recruitment of talent, morale boosting, retention, and professional development. In addition to all the benefits mentioned above to the institution, Employee Resource Groups help provide a positive image of the institution to the community. Members develop personally and professionally.
To attract and retain diverse, talented people at all levels, it is important for the ODEI to support activities creating a welcoming campus climate to promote and celebrate diversity at UT Dallas. If you would like to have more information on Employee Resource Groups at UT Dallas, please contact Rosie Peterson at ext. 4560 in the Department of Employee Equity Initiatives.
The executive sponsor plays a critical role in the success of each ERG. The executive sponsor is not an honorary or figurehead position; executive sponsors should plan to play an active role with the ERG. One element of that role is to make sure the ERG stays focused on problem-solving and assistance to UTD’s diversity/inclusion efforts in recruitment and retention.
Executive sponsors may be identified by ERG members, may volunteer or may be invited to participate by the vice president of ODEI. Executive sponsors will be selected after review by the senior leadership of ODEI.
Ideally, executive sponsors are:

If you are a benefits-eligible full-time employee working 30-40 hours per week, you are automatically enrolled in the Basic Coverage Package, at the employee only level. UT Dallas and the State of Texas will pay 100% of your employee-only premiums for the Basic Coverage Package, so you get these benefits with no out-of-pocket costs.
For our benefits-eligible part-time employees working 20-29 hours per week, UT Dallas and the State of Texas will pay 50% of your employee-only premiums for the Basic Coverage Package.

Part-time colleagues are eligible for $168.79/month in premium sharing credits.

The University of Texas at Dallas provides employees with many types of paid time off.
Eligible employees appointed to work at least 20 hours per week for at least 4.5 months are eligible to receive paid vacation leave each year. The amount of vacation earned is determined by the employee’s length of service. For additional information, please refer to the vacation leave policy.
Eligible employees may begin to use vacation accruals after six months of continuous state employment; additionally:
Students holding positions for which student status is a requirement for employment are not eligible for vacation leave. Faculty do not earn vacation leave.
Vacation time off begins to accrue on your first day of employment. After that, it will accrue on the first day of each month. The number of hours you earn is based on how much state service you have on the first day of the month. It’s also earned in proportion to the number of hours you’re appointed. If you reach a higher state service level during the month, you will begin earning the higher accrual hours in the following month.
New UT Dallas employees with prior state employment or departing UT Dallas employees who transfer to another state agency may have their vacation leave transferred to their new positions where appropriate.
Upon termination or separation from the University, an employee who has completed six months of continuous service is entitled to a lump-sum payment for all eligible unused vacation time. Vacation payouts are generally processed within 30-days after termination. Payouts may be delayed during the winter break due to University closure.
If you set up a UTSaver DCP-457(b) account before ending your time with the University, you can deposit all or part of your unused annual leave pay into this account by contacting your Benefits Representative.
You accrue paid sick time off if you are appointed to work at least 20 hours per week for at least 4.5 months. Students who are in positions where student status is a requirement do not earn sick time off. For more information, please refer to the sick leave policy.
Medical documentation provided by the employee often contains medical diagnosis and history, or lists medication used in the treatment plan. This is confidential and should not be forwarded or shared with other employees, or retained within the department. Employees should submit documentation directly to their HR leave administrator.
Employees may use up to eight hours of eligible sick leave with pay each fiscal year to attend an educational activity relating to their children in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade. For purposes of using this leave type, an educational activity means a school-sponsored activity, including registration, a parent-teacher conference, tutoring, a volunteer program, a field trip, a classroom program, a school committee meeting, an academic competition, an athletic event, or a music or theater program.
New UT Dallas employees with prior state employment or departing UT Dallas employees who transfer to another state agency may have their sick leave transferred to their new state agency where appropriate.
Employees do not receive monetary compensation for unused sick leave accruals at the time of separation. In general, an employee has three options regarding his/her sick leave balance upon termination:
An employee will have sick leave restored if she/he leaves state employment but is re-employed within 12 months after the end of the month in which employment ended.
UT Dallas has established a sick leave pool to provide a source of additional paid sick leave for employees who have exhausted their available sick, vacation and compensatory time as a result of a catastrophic illness or injury. For more information, please see the Sick Leave Pool Policy.
Employees must have a recent application on file before sick leave pool awards will be considered. Retroactive granting of sick leave pool is not permitted, employee awards will be considered from the date the application is received.
UT Dallas employees may donate sick leave hours directly to another UT Dallas employee.
An employee may donate sick leave to another sick leave eligible staff or faculty member employed at The University of Texas at Dallas when all of the following conditions are met:
Employees may not directly or indirectly provide or receive remuneration or a gift in exchange for a sick leave donation.
Taxation related to employee-to-employee sick leave donations will be consistent with the Internal Revenue Service and UT System guidelines. Employees who donate to another UTD employee will be taxed for the number of hours donated.
Employees separating from the University who wish to donate their sick leave to another UTD employee must contact the Office of Human Resources 30-days prior to their termination date.
All employees must log in to Galaxy to enter their time into their timesheets based on the type of position they have to ensure their paycheck and vacation and sick balances are correct. If they did not use any paid time off, they must still indicate they have “nothing to report” on their timesheet. View the Time and Labor training materials for more information on how to enter your time.
Employees also can view their vacation and sick time balances in Galaxy. Employees should report any discrepancies regarding their balances to their supervisor for verification and correction.

UT Dallas benefits-eligible employees are required to enroll in a retirement plan with either the Teacher Retirement System of Texas (TRS) or the Optional Retirement Program (ORP). Employer contributions are made to these plans in addition to the contributions made by employees.
Eligibility: To be eligible to participate in TRS, an employee must be employed in a benefits-eligible position for at least 20 hours per week and 4 ½ continuous months. To be eligible to participate in ORP, an employee must: (1) initially be appointed on a full-time basis (40 hours per week) and 4 ½ or more; and (2) be appointed to a position otherwise eligible to participate in ORP.
Employees have the option to participate in additional UTSaver voluntary retirement programs, such as the UTSaver TSA-403(b) or the UTSaver DCP-457(b). These plans are based on employee contributions only; UT Dallas does not make employer contributions to these plans.
Eligibility: Anyone receiving a salary with UT Dallas is eligible to participate in the voluntary retirement program known as UTSaver. This includes graduate student employees, temporary employees, part-time employees, and return-to-work retirees.

Alumni Benefits
What we're doing for you
Showcase your school pride and accomplishment with the UT Dallas ring, offered through Balfour. Then, participate in the tradition of the Ring Ceremony after graduation.
The Star of Texas circled by the UT Dallas Comet in the Oak Leaves of Education is our promise to look to the future and to make use of our education to move our state, our nation and our world to a better tomorrow. The Lone Star is the symbol of our heritage and our drive to conquer all frontiers. UT Dallas' Comet reflects the University's roots in science and technology, and points the way to the future where new discoveries and knowledge await.
Who can purchase a UT Dallas ring?
Current undergraduate students with 75+ hours, graduate students with 15+ hours, and of course, UT Dallas alumni. 
What do the symbols on the UT Dallas ring mean?
The letters “UTD,” which appear prominently on the top of the UT Dallas ring, identify you as a graduate of UT Dallas.
The comet encircling the Lone Star of Texas on one side of the ring reminds you to use your education to move our world to a better tomorrow.
The Texas flag reminds us of the heritage, frontier spirit, and entrepreneurial legacy that built this state and our university.
The seal of the University of Texas system is featured on one side of your ring, with “1969,” the year of the University’s founding, written below the seal.
Where can I see the UT Dallas ring in person?
Come to the Comet Countdown to Commencement or the UT Dallas Ring Days to see the ring and visit with Balfour. Can’t make the events? Visit the UT Dallas bookstore any time during business hours to view the ring.
Where can I purchase the UT Dallas ring?
You can order your ring in person during the Comet Countdown to Commencement event or UT Dallas Ring Days, online on the UT Dallas Ring webpage, or over the phone by calling Balfour at 1-800-BALFOUR (800-225-3687). 
What are Ring Days?
UT Dallas holds two ‘Ring Days’ each semester when Balfour representatives will be on the UT Dallas campus to take orders and to answer questions. Check out the list of Upcoming Events to find out dates for the spring or fall Ring Days. 
What is the last day to order a ring in order to take part in the UT Dallas Ring Ceremony?
The last day in which to place an order for your ring in order to participate in the UT Dallas Ring Ceremony -- for that particular semester -- will be listed under Upcoming Events. 
Can I still order a ring if I miss the UT Dallas Ring Ceremony order deadline?
Yes, you may order your ring anytime. If you miss the Ring Ceremony deadline, Balfour will ship you your ring after the UT Dallas Ring Ceremony.
I missed my ring ceremony. Where do I pick up my ring? Can I still participate in the next one? 
If you are unable to participate in the ring ceremony, you may pick up your ring the day after the ceremony at the Alumni Relations office. Details will be on the registration page. 
We hold a ring ceremony every fall and spring, during commencement week. We encourage you to return the next semester to partake in the ceremony and the ring dunk tradition (even if you already graduated). All you have to do is let us know ahead of time that you want to participate, bring your ring back and we will formally present it to you on stage.

Supporters like you help drive a focus on academic and research excellence that will give today’s students the tools they need to transform the future.
With only your signature, you can create your legacy as a founder of the future of UT Dallas. Once your family and loved ones are provided for, we hope you’ll consider a gift to UT Dallas in your will or trust, or by beneficiary designation. It costs you nothing now to do this, yet your impact lasts for generations to come. And you can change your mind about the amount of your gift — or giving at all — at any time.
Learn about Wills and Living Trusts or Beneficiary Designation gifts.
Did you know there are ways to support excellence at UT Dallas that pay you income for life? These gifts allow you the chance to stretch your giving ability and help you make a substantial gift to UT Dallas while receiving a steady income.
Set up a charitable gift annuity with a minimum of $10,000 for UT Dallas, and you can receive fixed payments for life while enjoying significant tax advantages. Interest rates paid on CGAs are usually higher than certificates of deposit and similar investments.
Learn about Charitable Gift Annuities and Charitable Remainder Trusts.
As a generous contributor to the vision of excellence and innovation at UT Dallas, you can feel good about giving with the knowledge that your gift will benefit the area you wish to support most. Invest in the area of UT Dallas that means most to you. Direct your generosity toward scholarships and fellowships, campus enhancements, the Fund for UT Dallas, or any school, center or special program.
Together, we strengthen our academic community by providing excellent, innovative education and research that will enrich the lives of our students and community. There are many opportunities to make a lasting difference for the University and the students it serves. Those opportunities include gifts through donor-advised funds, IRA charitable rollovers, real estate, life insurance and stock.
The Legacy Society pays tribute to individuals who make a gift to UT Dallas that lives on after their lifetime. Legacy Society members most often contribute through a planned gift in their will or trust. Others establish charitable gift annuities, which pay them income for life; some name UTD as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy or retirement account.
Questions about how specific gifts can meet your unique needs and goals?
We’re here to help.

The Office of Financial Aid has detailed information about UT Dallas scholarship opportunities and programs to help pay for college.
The University’s Office of Financial Aid is the primary resource for more information about UT Dallas scholarships and those offered by third parties and can guide your student through the application process.
Check the Estimated Cost of Attendance at UT Dallas as determined by the Office of Financial Aid each year and based on the average costs students may incur each semester. Actual costs will vary from student to student.
Current and admitted students may obtain an estimate of their tuition and fees from their Orion Self-Service portal. Students must log in to Orion through the Galaxy portal. Once in Orion, click on “Self-Service” and then click on “Campus Finances”. Underneath “Campus Finances”, there will be a link for “Tuition Estimate Self-Service.”
The University offers a Guaranteed Tuition Plan to help families better manage the cost of a college education. The plan also provides an incentive for students to earn degrees in a timely manner since additional courses taken beyond 15 credit hours each semester will, in essence, be free. (However, students may be responsible for per-hour supplemental fees.)
Charges per semester credit hour for tuition and mandatory fees at UT Dallas depend on the number of hours for which a student enrolls, up to 15. Nonresident students from out of state pay a higher rate per credit hour. Other nonmandatory fees, including parking and housing, will be subject to change.
The University’s Bursar Office is responsible for billing and payments of tuition and fees. Students can use EZPay to manage their tuition finances and make payments. Parents and guardians require the student’s permission, granted through the student’s authorized user process, to become authorized users in the system and make payments.
The payment options website also has information regarding short-term loans, and installment payment plans. Contact the Bursars Office at 972-883-2612 for questions regarding tuition and fees.

BRETTELL An Artist’s Homage to the Dynamic Influence of Rick Brettell
Trammell and Margaret Crow bought their first piece of Asian art in the mid-1960s. From that initial purchase, a distinguished collection of Asian art has evolved. The collection features pieces from China, Japan, India, Korea and Southeastern Asia spanning from historical to contemporary. Visit the homepage of the Crow Museum of Asian Art.
The grand opening of the SP/N Gallery was on October 1, 2017. Our first show was Critical Mass: a UT Dallas Artist Alumni Exhibition. This inaugural show not only celebrated the grand opening of the SP/N Gallery, but featured two decades worth of artists who have successfully pursued their creative practice after receiving their degrees from the School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology. Work from more than 40 alumni was on display.

(Editor’s Note: The donor has chosen a different direction for the placement of his collection, and therefore the Barrett Collection will not become a part of the growing arts collections and initiatives at UT Dallas.)
The University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) announced the gift to the University of the Barrett Collection, consisting of over 400 works of Swiss art. It is the single-largest donation ever made to UTD as well as the largest gift of art to any school in The University of Texas System. This unparalleled collection of paintings, sculpture, drawings and prints is the only definitive collection of Swiss art outside of Switzerland and is considered the largest and finest private collection of Swiss art ever formed. With works dating from the late 14th through the mid-20th century, the Barrett Collection includes important pieces by every major artist born in Switzerland, from Caspar Wolf (1735-1783), the first painter of the Swiss Alps, to Cuno Amiet (1868-1961).
Recognized for its excellence in science, engineering and business, UTD has recently placed greater emphasis on the arts. With the creation of the Edith O’Donnell Institute of Art History in 2014, the University has fostered innovative research and graduate education in the history of art, embracing a global history of art that ranges across geography, chronology and medium. The gift of the Barrett Collection, which will be housed in a new Barrett Museum to be built on campus, will extend the vision for the O’Donnell Institute, attracting new scholars and expanding the role of the arts across the University.
“The arts are an essential facet of any great university,” said Dr. Richard C. Benson, president of UTD. “I am grateful to the Barretts for this generous gift, which will catalyze the development of arts programs at the O’Donnell Institute at UTD and provide our students with direct access to an extraordinary collection.”
The collection was started in the 1990s by Dallas residents Nona and Richard Barrett. As a result of extensive travel in the country, they realized early on that, outside of Switzerland, Swiss art was widely unknown, underappreciated and undervalued. After an early visit to the collection of Mme. Monique Barbier-Mueller in Geneva, they made their first acquisition at Art Basel of a painting by Ferdinand Hodler. Relying on knowledge gleaned through research and their rapidly developing private library, along with guidance from curators, dealers and art historians, the Barretts have become the most knowledgeable American collectors of Swiss art of the past two generations. This has enabled them to build the present collection, often acquiring works before they reach the market. Since Nona’s death in 2014, Richard and his present wife, Luba, have continued to expand the collection.

“We have benefited so much from our city of Dallas and are glad to have an opportunity to give something back. Our wish is for our collection to remain intact and have a permanent, public home in our own city as well as in Texas. The building of the Barrett Museum on the UTD campus not only will achieve that, but will enable the collection to continue to grow through future support from the Barrett Collection Foundation,” said Richard Barrett. “Our dearest hope is that this gift will enhance the cultural fabric of this fine university.”
Noted both for its completeness and the depth of holdings of works by the most important Swiss-born artists, the Barrett Collection has drawn the attention of art historians, curators, and museum directors from around the globe. Works from the collection have been on view at major art institutions internationally, including the Tate Britain, Kunsthaus Zurich, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Musée d’Orsay, among others. Representative works in the collection include:
Dr. Richard Brettell, a scholar of modern painting and founding director of the O’Donnell Institute, has known the collection since its inception. He has worked closely with the Barretts to develop plans for the museum, which will be unique in the world outside Switzerland.
“The creation of a museum with a collection of this breadth and depth of Swiss art at its core is unprecedented in the United States. But bringing this collection to a major research university makes the significance of the gift even greater,” Brettell said. “The focus and range of the Barrett Collection will spark many new dissertations, articles and books written by our graduate students and faculty.”
In addition to the works currently in the collection, UTD will also receive funding from the Barrett Collection Foundation for future acquisitions, including works by post-World War II and contemporary Swiss artists.
About the Barrett Collection
The major works of the Barrett Collection demonstrate the range of Swiss artists who traveled and spent extensive periods in Russia, England, Spain, Austria, France, Germany and Italy in addition to their native Switzerland. Thus, the Barrett Collection is devoted in its fullest sense to European art seen through the lens of Swiss-born artists. The core of the collection is composed of 11 works by Caspar Wolf, 12 by Angelika Kauffmann, seven by Heinrich Füssli, six by Arnold Böcklin, 50 by the 19th-century Swiss landscape masters, 38 by Ferdinand Hodler, 34 by Felix Vallotton and 41 by Cuno Amiet. The collection also includes works by artists less well-known outside Switzerland itself as well as artists who often are considered French (Léopold Robert and Marc Gabriel Charles Gleyre) or Italian (Sigismund Righini and Giovanni Segantini). The Barretts amassed a virtually definitive collection of the work of Giovanni Giacometti (father of the more famous Alberto and Diego Giacometti) and their cousin Augusto Giacometti, whose chromatic paintings and works on paper are scarcely collected outside Switzerland. The collection also has several works by artists whose careers are only now being carefully studied, including Max Buri and Ernest Biéler.
The following examples highlight the depth and breadth of the Barrett Collection:

Jean-Etienne Liotard, Maria Theresa, Empress of Austria, 1762: The two most powerful women in the world in the 18th century were Catherine the Great of Russia and Maria Theresa, Empress of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose large family intermarried with virtually every other important royal family of Europe. Liotard traveled to Vienna to paint the Empress and her family first in 1742, returning several times. During those visits, he represented the Empress herself in pastel and oil, and made drawings and paintings of all her children in what is among the most sustained collective portraits of a royal family by any European artist. The Barrett Collection portrait is pastel on vellum and relates to the official portrait in oil and seems to be done about the same time as a somewhat more elaborate pastel now in the collection of the Musée des Beaux Arts in the artist’s native Geneva.

Angelika Kauffmann, Ulysses on the Island of Circe, 1793:  Angelika Kauffmann was, during her lifetime, famous throughout Europe and was one of only two female artists who were founding members of the Royal Academy in London. Fluent in several European languages, she was at home in most of the capital cities of the continent and made paintings on commission for aristocrats and intellectuals. (Her portrait of the youthful Goethe painted in Rome is an example). Her greatest ambition, like most male artists of her generation, was to excel as a History Painter, and she made large-scale exhibition paintings throughout her life. The Barrett Collection holdings of works by Kauffmann is virtually definitive and contains, in addition to portraits and small scale mythological and literary paintings, two large-scale history paintings, both involved with the life of Ulysses. Ulysses on the Island of Circe is the largest and was painted during the artist’s later years in Rome, where she died in 1807.

Ferdinand Hodler, Landscape with Rhythmic Shapes, 1908:  Ferdinand Hodler was the principal painter from Switzerland during his lifetime and is the only Swiss painter to take his place in the pantheon on modern painting. The Barrett Collection’s 38 works form a true retrospective of his pictorial achievements on canvas and paper and represent his career from its earliest landscapes painted for tourists to his elaborate figural allegories. In the end, Hodler’s rhythmic landscapes of his native Switzerland, particularly of Lac Léman (Lake Geneva), around which he lived much of his life, are his most perfect works, and the rhythmic landscape in the Barrett Collection makes fully evident Hodler’s fascination with the parallels between the visual rhythms of nature and the rhythms of music. Like many advanced artists of his generation, Hodler believed in synesthesia, in which color and sound, composed by painters and musical composers, are fundamentally unified.

Cuno Amiet, Women in the Garden, 1910:  Of the masters of Swiss modernism — Ferdinand Hodler, Felix Vallotton, and Cuno Amiet — the latter is the least known outside his native country. Yet, in his fascinating interactions with the two competing forms of artistic modernism — the French and the German, he made important contributions to both. Amiet started his vanguard career by training at the Academie Julian in Paris and went to Pont-Aven in Brittany to follow in the footsteps of his hero Paul Gauguin. His fluency in German and his fascination with the early forms of what is now known as German Expressionism led him to early membership in the Berlin-based group, Die Brücke, later in his career. This “bicultural modernism” and his relationship with the great collectors of modernist paintings, Josef Müller and his sister Gertrud Dubi-Müller, gave him firsthand knowledge of works by van Gogh, Gauguin and Kandinsky. This 1910 painting, Women in the Garden, is part of a series of paintings that approach the French notion of the “decorative,” but injecting it with a chromatic power that belies its gentle subject.
Giovanni Giacometti, Bathers (Alberto and Diego), 1919: Giovanni Giacometti was not Italian, as his name suggests, but Swiss, and descended from a family living in the Italian-speaking Stampa, Switzerland, where he painted, assisted the great Italian-born Swiss painter, Segantini, and raised a family devoted to art. Two of his three sons, Alberto and Diego Giacometti, left this part of Switzerland as young men for Paris, where, Alberto, with the assistance of Diego, became one of the most famous artists in the world. Often considered French, Alberto was selected by the French government to be the artist for the French Pavilion of the 1962 Venice Biennale, hence forever confusing his national origins. In this work in the Barrett Collection, we see their father representing his two soon-to-be famous sons swimming on a beautiful summer day in Switzerland. The Barrett Collection includes more than 25 works by Giovanni Giacometti and his less-well-known, but even more inventive artist-cousin, Augusto Giacometti, making it possible to understand the Swiss roots of this dynasty of European artists.

Galaxy
Galaxy, the Orion, Gemini FMS and Gemini HCM systems has a new user interface which will provide numerous benefits for faculty and staff. This new look and feel is currently used by our students and applicants and now been expanded to the entire UTD community.

To have an optimized user experience: User-specific Homepages and a collection of quick link tiles to commonly used pages or external websites.
Benefits include:
The Fluid Interface is designed to be used on mobile devices as well as laptops and desktops. It is responsive and recognizes the device form factor being used and adapts the layout to optimize the user’s experience.




The Fluid User Interface was designed to be used on mobile devices, but can also be used on a laptop and desktop. The Fluid User Interface is more than a mobile platform; it is responsive and recognizes the device form factor being used and adapts the layout to optimize the user’s experience.
On the upper right of the page, you will see a compass button. That will open the NavBar. The NavBar contains Tiles to Recent Places, My Favorites, the Navigator and My Preferences.
The main menu has been moved from the left of the page to the right in the NavBar. The Navigator is the new main menu. It provides navigation access to all components that are provisioned to a user based on existing security roles.
If you select the down arrow next to the Faculty Center label, you will see an option for Gemini for Departments. Select that and you will be able to view you Gemini functions.
On the Gemini for Departments Homepage, go to the Self Service tile, then select the Payroll and Compensation tile.
On the Gemini for Departments Homepage, go to the Self Service tile, then select the ACA Form 1095-C tile.
On the Gemini for Departments Homepage, select the External Links tile. eProcurement will be one of the available tiles for you to choose.
Fluid navigation uses Homepages and Tiles as the starting point for navigation within the system. Within Tiles you will have either a collection of links or a link to a page. The functionality of pages is not changing, just the look and feel. Some pages may be larger than before the upgrade.
A Fluid Homepage organizes navigation in an easy, familiar way for the user to access key parts of the PeopleSoft system. Homepages are the starting point for navigation in Fluid. A user can have several homepages and one default homepage that is displayed after login.
When you open the NavBar, you will see tiles for Recent Places and My Favorites.
The Action List button can be found at the top right – the 3 dots. This button allows users to personalize the order of their Homepages as well as Sign Out.
If the user navigates to a specific page, the menu of the Actions List button will change, and you will now have the option to add this specific page to your favorites or open a new window. You will still have the options of changing the settings and signing out.
Select the 3 dots “Action List” in the upper right. Choose the Sign Out option. It is recommended that to ensure you are signed out of all services, close your web browser.

Off-campus, out-of-state, foreign instruction/travel, and course-related field trip activities are subject to state law and university policies and procedures regarding travel and risk-related activities.
Detailed information regarding this policy, in accordance to Texas Education Code, Section 51.950, can be accessed through the UT Dallas Policy Navigator, https://policy.utdallas.edu/utdbp3023, and at https://legal.utdallas.edu/risk-insurance/travel-related-risk/. Additional information is available from the office of the school dean.
The University of Texas System (Regents' Rule 50101) and UT Dallas have rules and regulations for the orderly and efficient conduct of their business. It is the responsibility of each student and each student organization to be knowledgeable about the rules and regulations which govern student conduct and activities. General information on student conduct and discipline is contained in the Student Complaints Resources in the online UT Dallas Undergraduate Catalog, https://catalog.utdallas.edu/now/undergraduate/resources/student-complaints and the Graduate Catalog, https://catalog.utdallas.edu/now/graduate/resources/student-complaints.
UT Dallas administers student discipline within the procedures of recognized and established due process. Procedures are defined and described in the Student Code of Conduct, UTDSP5003 (https://policy.utdallas.edu/utdsp5003). Copies of these rules and regulations are available to students in the Office of Community Standards and Conduct, where staff members are available to assist students in interpreting the rules and regulations (SSB 4.400, 972-883-6330) and online at https://conduct.utdallas.edu.
A student at the University neither loses their rights nor escapes the responsibilities of citizenship. He or she is expected to obey federal, state, and local laws as well as the Regents' Rules, university regulations, and administrative rules. Students are subject to discipline for violating its standards of conduct whether such conduct takes place on or off campus, or whether civil or criminal penalties are also imposed for such conduct.
The Student Code of Conduct includes behaviors conducted via any digital platform. Students may not use any digital platform to seek or provide unauthorized assistance for any assignment done for academic credit. Students may not use any digital platform to impersonate or represent any person other than themselves. Please consult with your instructor regarding authorized assistance.
The faculty expects from its students a high-level of responsibility and academic honesty. Because the value of an academic degree depends upon the absolute integrity of the work done by the student for that degree, it is imperative that a student demonstrates a high standard of individual honor in his or her scholastic work. See https://conduct.utdallas.edu/integrity.
Academic Dishonesty: Academic dishonesty can occur in relation to any type of work submitted for academic credit or as a requirement for a class. It can include individual work or a group project. Academic dishonesty includes plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, and collaboration/collusion. In order to avoid academic dishonesty, it is important for students to fully understand the expectations of their professors. This is best accomplished through asking clarifying questions if an individual does not completely understand the requirements of an assignment.
Additional information related to academic dishonesty and tips on how to avoid dishonesty may be found here: https://conduct.utdallas.edu/dishonesty.
It is the policy of UT Dallas to adhere to the requirements of the United States Copyright Law of 1976, as amended, (Title 17, United States Code), including ensuring that the restrictions that apply to the reproduction of software are adhered to and that the bounds of copying permissible under the fair use doctrine are not exceeded. Copying, displaying, reproducing, or distributing copyrighted material may infringe upon the copyright owner's rights. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material, including unauthorized peer-to-peer file sharing, may subject students to appropriate disciplinary action as well as civil and criminal penalties. Usage of such material is only appropriate when that usage constitutes "fair use" under the Copyright Act. For more information about the fair use exemption, see https://guides.lib.utexas.edu/fairuse/home. As a UT Dallas student, you are required to follow UT Dallas' copyright policy (UTDPP1043 at https://policy.utdallas.edu/utdpp1043) and the UT System's policy, UTS107 at https://www.utsystem.edu/board-of-regents/policy-library/policies/uts107-use-copyrighted-materials.
UT Dallas recognizes the value and efficiency of communication between faculty/staff and students through electronic mail. At the same time, email raises some issues concerning security and the identity of each individual in an email exchange. All official student email correspondence will be sent only to a student's UT Dallas email address and UT Dallas will only consider email requests originating from an official UT Dallas student email account. This allows the University to maintain a high degree of confidence in the identity of each individual corresponding via email and the security of the transmitted information. UT Dallas furnishes each student with a free email account that is to be used in all communication with university personnel. The Office of Information Technology provides a method for students to have their UT Dallas mail forwarded to other email accounts. To activate a student UT Dallas computer account and forward email to another account, go to https://oit.utdallas.edu/netid/self-service.
The University's attendance policy requirement is that individual faculty set their course attendance requirements. Regular and punctual class attendance is expected regardless of course modality. Students who fail to attend class regularly are inviting scholastic difficulty. In some courses, instructors may have special attendance requirements; these should be made known to students during the first week of classes.
Regular class participation is expected regardless of course modality. Students who fail to participate in class regularly are inviting scholastic difficulty. A portion of the grade in the course is directly tied to class participation. It also includes students' engagement in group or other activities during class that solicit feedback on homework assignments, readings, and/or materials covered in the lectures and/or labs. Class participation is documented by faculty. Successful class participation is defined as consistently adhering to University requirements, as presented in the syllabus. Failure to comply with these University requirements is a violation of the Student Code of Conduct - UTSP5003.
Students are encouraged to review the online catalogs regarding Credit/No Credit or Pass/Fail courses. Students should consult their academic advisors to understand what it means for their academic careers before completing the form prior to Census Day.
Undergraduate students: please review the Credit/No Credit Classes section in the Undergraduate Catalog.
Graduate students: please review the Pass/Fail Grading section in the Graduate Catalog.

It is the student's responsibility to complete and submit the appropriate forms to the Registrar's Office and ensure that he or she will not receive a final grade of "F" in a course if he or she chooses not to attend the class after being enrolled.
Undergraduate students: please review the Dropping and Withdrawing section in the catalog.
Graduate students: please review the Schedule Changes: Dropping, Adding and Withdrawing from Courses section in the catalog.
Procedures for student grievances are found in university policy UTDSP5005 (https://policy.utdallas.edu/utdsp5005). In attempting to resolve any student grievance regarding disputes over grades, application of degree plan, graduation/degree program requirements, and thesis/and dissertation committee, adviser actions and/or decisions, evaluations, and/or other fulfillments of academic responsibility, it is the obligation of the student first to make a serious effort to resolve the matter with the instructor, supervisor, administrator, or committee with whom the grievance originated.
As per university policy, incomplete grades may be given at the discretion of the instructor of record for a course, when a student has completed at least 70% of the required course material but cannot complete all requirements by the end of the semester. An incomplete course grade (grade of 'I') must be completed within the time period specified by the instructor, not to exceed eight (8) weeks from the first day of the subsequent long semester. Upon completion of the required work, the grade of 'I' may be converted into a letter grade (A through F). If the grade of Incomplete is not removed by the end of the specified period, it will automatically be changed to a grade of F. The incomplete grade policy is included in the online UT Dallas Undergraduate Catalog, https://catalog.utdallas.edu/now/undergraduate/policies/academic#incomplete-grades and the Graduate Catalog, https://catalog.utdallas.edu/now/graduate/policies/grades#grade-of-i-incomplete.
The University of Texas at Dallas is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for all persons with disabilities. The syllabus is available in alternate formats upon request. If you are seeking classroom accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (2008), you are required to register with the AccessAbility Resource Center (ARC), located in the Administration Building, Suite 2.224. Their phone number is 972-883-2098, email: studentaccess@utdallas.edu and the website is https://accessability.utdallas.edu/. To receive academic accommodations for this class, please register and request services by completing the Request for Services form with the proper documentation and meet with the Director of ARC at the beginning of the semester.
UT Dallas will excuse a student from class or other required activities, including examinations and travel time, for the observance of a religious holy day for a religion whose places of worship are exempt from property tax under Section 11.20, of the Texas Tax Code.
Students are encouraged to notify the instructor or activity sponsor as soon as possible regarding the absence, preferably in advance of the assignment.
Excused students will be allowed to take missed exams or complete assignments within a reasonable time after the absence: a period equal to the length of the absence, up to a maximum of one week. A student who notifies the instructor and completes any missed exam or assignment may not be penalized for the absence. A student who fails to complete the exam or assignment within the prescribed period may receive a failing grade for that exam or assignment.
If a student or an instructor disagrees about the nature of the absence [i.e., for the purpose of observing a religious holy day] or if there is similar disagreement about whether the student has been given a reasonable time to complete any missed assignments or examinations, either the student or the instructor may request a ruling from the school's vice or associate dean, who serve as the President's designees for these rules. The vice or associate deans must take into account the legislative intent of Texas Education Code 51.911(b), and the student and instructor will abide by the decision of the vice or associate dean.

    This information is also included in the online UT Dallas Undergraduate Catalog, https://catalog.utdallas.edu/now/undergraduate/policies/religious-holy-days, and the Graduate Catalog, https://catalog.utdallas.edu/now/graduate/policies/religious-holy-days.
Making a False Alarm or Report Involving a Public or Private Institution of a Higher Education
Making a false threat at any Texas higher education institution is considered a State Jail Felony, not a Class A misdemeanor, according to a law passed by the Texas Legislature.
This legislation was enacted in response to several threats in past years at several universities across the U.S. that disrupted classes and prompted evacuation of campus property, even though the reports turned out to be a hoax.
This law relates to the offense of making or causing a false alarm or report involving a public or private institution of higher education. A person commits an offense under Section 42.06, Texas Penal Code, if he or she knowingly initiates, communicates or circulates a report of a present, past, or future bombing, fire, offense, or other emergency that he or she knows is false or baseless and that would ordinarily:

Cause action by an official or volunteer agency organized to deal with emergencies;
Place a person in fear of imminent serious bodily injury; or
Prevent or interrupt the occupation of a building, room, place of assembly, place to which the public has access, or aircraft, automobile, or other mode of conveyance.

An individual adjudged guilty of a state jail felony shall be punished by confinement in a state jail for any term of not more than two years or less than 180 days and, in addition to confinement, may be punished by a fine not to exceed $10,000.
UT Dallas students should be aware that the State of Texas takes these threats seriously, and the legal consequences, which are severe, go beyond anything that the University's disciplinary committee can address.
This information is also included in the online UT Dallas Undergraduate Catalog, https://catalog.utdallas.edu/now/undergraduate/policies/false-alarms and in the Graduate Catalog, https://catalog.utdallas.edu/now/graduate/policies/false-alarms.
