 the university of texas at dallasquestions or comments about this page
neuroscientists have known since the 19th century that corresponding regions of the left and right hemispheres of the brain dont always perform the same functions imaging studies have more recently documented this lateralization in the context of chronic pain specifically in the amygdala where emotional processing also occurs
a team of researchers led by dr benedict kolber associate professor of neuroscience in the school of behavioral and brain sciences at the university of texas at dallas has demonstrated in mice that a single neuropeptide has opposite effects on chronic bladder pain when the molecule is active in matching regions of opposite hemispheres of the brain the research was published in the feb 15 print issue of the journal biological psychiatry
this finding is particularly striking  its flip sides of the same coin said kolber who is corresponding author of the study and is affiliated with the center for advanced pain studies at utd its bizarre it speaks to the flexibility of natural systems while in many cases theres redundancy there can also be specialization that evolves
kolbers team conducted its study on a mouse model of bladder pain when the researchers introduced the protein calcitonin generelated peptide cgrp to the animals amygdalae they found that cgrp administered in the right side increased behavioral signs of bladder pain but when administered in the left side it decreased painlike behavior in the bladder
there are other examples in the amygdala of situations in which one side has a specialized receptor that increases pain and the other side doesnt do anything but none with counteractive effects like this kolber said cgrp is driving pain on the right side and reducing pain on the left
lead author dr heather allen a ut dallas visiting scholar and a postdoctoral associate at new york university said that lateralization is often ignored in pain research
this finding is particularly striking  its flip sides of the same coin its bizarre it speaks to the flexibility of natural systems while in many cases theres redundancy there can also be specialization that evolves
dr benedict kolber associate professor of neuroscience in the school of behavioral and brain sciences
here we demonstrate that bladder pain  visceral pain in a centrally located organ  is processed differently on the left and right sides of the brain she said if we had focused on only one side of the amygdala we would have completely missed out on discovering these divergent functions
kolbers area of expertise is urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome an umbrella term for varieties of pain that affect an estimated 10 million people in the us each year primarily middleaged women
its a huge area of clinical need and we dont know how to treat it he said so while this is a broader story about lateralization were also seeking specific answers the patient is the priority  i want to understand this disease so it can be treated in humans
to learn more about how ut dallas is enhancing lives through transformative research explore new dimensions the campaign for ut dallas
kolber said there have probably been hundreds of studies that went unpublished by researchers who moved on because they assumed there was no difference between hemispheres he said his groups results could enable progress in research on other medical conditions including stroke depression and some learning and memory phenomena
were discovering something about nature something fundamental thats really exciting he said
allen said the next step is to identify the reason for the polar opposite behavior on matching sides of the brain in response to the same neuropeptide
we are currently investigating the signaling pathway from cgrppositive cells in the amygdala to other parts of the brain to see if that provides any evidence she said we are also investigating these findings in other pain models to evaluate if this phenomenon is isolated to bladder pain or whether it extends to other types of pain
chronic pain treatments are often ineffective largely because we still dont truly understand the underlying mechanisms understanding these pain pathways will hopefully help us design effective therapeutics in the future
additional contributors to the research include ut dallas neuroscience research associate dr lakeisha lewter and cognition and neuroscience doctoral student veronica hong as well as researchers from the university of pittsburgh and the national center for complementary and integrative health of the national institutes of health nih
the work was supported by three nih grants f31dk121484 r01dk115478 and f32dk128969

university of texas at dallas bioengineers have developed sensors that monitor multiple soil parameters including total soil carbon to provide farmers with accurate realtime continuous data to improve soil health and productivity
this is the equivalent of having a wearable health sensor on your body that tells you in realtime whats happening think of it as a wearable for the soil said dr shalini prasad department head of bioengineering and the cecil h and ida green professor in systems biology science in the erik jonsson school of engineering and computer science we are excited about the potential for our soil sensors to provide more accurate testing of living soil in its ecosystem
prasad who has developed wearable sensor technology to monitor various human health conditions such as diabetes received research funding through a twoyear ut dallas intellectual property assignmentsponsored research agreement ipasra to investigate the use of electrochemical methods to assess soil health for industry partner soil in formation sif a public benefit corporation in january sif sponsored additional research to advance the technology including technology to capture additional soil parameters
this is the equivalent of having a wearable health sensor on your body that tells you in realtime whats happening think of it as a wearable for the soil
dr shalini prasad the cecil h and ida green professor in systems biology science in the erik jonsson school of engineering and computer science
electrochemical soil testing involves applying electrical stimulation to the soil and measuring chemical reactions to the voltage prasads team described the testing of soil using electrochemical sensors in an article published june 29 2022 in the journal of the electrochemical society
the method developed by ut dallas researchers measures ph moisture volumetric bulk density and the two main soil carbon pools  levels of soil organic matter and carbonaceous soil minerals  as well as total soil carbon
the intellectual property assignment
sponsored research agreement ipasra model at ut dallas provides an industry sponsor the opportunity to own the intellectual property ip that results from a sponsorfunded research project giving the sponsor ownership of the ip upfront eliminates much of the risk and uncertainty around license negotiations and the subsequent financial obligations
prasad said the sensor represents a paradigm shift in soil testing typically soil is tested by digging up a sample and sending it to a lab or it is evaluated remotely by infrared methods or satellite sif wanted to develop a more direct and accurate method for testing soil as a dynamic living ecosystem
henry rowlands the companys research and development lead said this new soil health monitoring technology developed by utd researchers significantly improves the accuracy and auditability of soil test results
the sensors developed at utd should provide data that farmers and other stakeholders can use to improve soil health and mitigate climate change by improving soils ability to draw down carbon from the atmosphere rowlands said
as soil quality declines from damaging agricultural practices the technology could play a role in enabling the improvement of soil health on a global scale which also could help address food insecurity rowlands said

three university of texas at dallas researchers who are developing innovative ways to help save peoples lives have received secondtier baxter young investigator awards for their work
bioengineering postdoctoral researcher dr sasya madhurantakam biomedical engineering doctoral student ivneet banga and mechanical engineering research associate dr qi cai are the latest ut dallas recipients of the award which supports research to develop therapies and medical products that save and sustain patients lives ambalika tanak ms16 phd21 and badrinath jagannath phd21 were previous baxter award recipients from utd in 2020 and 2021 respectively
medical technology company baxter international inc named 17 winners of the award which included six firsttier recipients ut dallas was the only institution with more than two awardees in 2022
when madhurantakams fatherinlaw in india came down with a mild case of covid19 in 2020 the family thought he was better off recovering at home when he didnt seem to recover the family took him to the hospital but within three days he died
madhurantakam who was conducting postdoctoral work in japan and was not allowed to travel to india at the time saw the medical problem very clearly caretakers and hospital staff had no way to tell which covid19 patients needed a high level of hospital care and who would recover at home
she joined dr shalini prasads biomedical microdevices and nanotechnology laboratory at ut dallas to develop a way to quickly detect the severity of a patients infection
the method uses an electrochemical sensing technique originated by prasad department head of bioengineering and the cecil h and ida green professor in systems biology science
madhurantakams technology uses a blood sample to show whether a patient has covid19 and if so the severity of the disease the walletsized device senses the patients immune system response to covid19 with a strong response correlating to a more serious case of the disease
within minutes the device can detect the levels of four kinds of biomarkers even before a patient shows symptoms of infection
the development of a device that is useful to the community and society is the major contribution i can make said madhurantakam who also lost several other family members to covid19 i dont want to do research that is just limited to publications i want to develop technologies that are useful to people
banga also earned a baxter award for a disease detection device  a handheld breath analyzer  that can detect respiratory diseases including covid19 within seconds
when covid started we were all sitting at home banga said one day dr prasad asked whether we could design an electrochemical sensor for covid
we were getting reports that covid was affecting peoples lung capacity i thought that might be a good starting point
this breath analyzer platform is a firstofitskind screening tool for coronavirus detection in under five seconds said banga who previously was selected as one of two runnersup for a young chemist award from laboratory equipment manufacturer metrohm usa
the device detects levels of volatile organic compounds in the breath that increase when a patient has covid19 or other respiratory infections
bangas future work includes studying the devices potential for detecting other serious diseases
it is exciting to see the great strides our doctoral students and early career researchers are making in developing cuttingedge technology that demonstrates promise in translating from bench to bedside or to homes prasad said the nurturing and vibrant environment at ut dallas plays a critical role in empowering these young minds to dream big for a global impact
cai works with dr zhenpeng qin associate professor of mechanical engineering and fellow eugene mcdermott professor and other researchers in his lab ondeveloping a techniqueto temporarily open the bloodbrain barrier to deliver medicine to the brain
on one side this can help our brain be healthy maintain normal function she said about the dynamic barrier that protects the brain on the other side it prevents the drugs from getting into the brain
with qin cai and her colleagues developed a method to temporarily prop open cells in the membrane using gold nanoparticles to allow medicine to enter they showed that the approach is safe and doesnt harm blood vessels or brain activity
that means for example that cancer medication might be delivered into the brain to treat glioblastoma a particularly deadly type of cancer due to the difficulty of getting medication past the brains barrier to the tumors
the prestigious baxter award is a coveted honor in the field of engineering and applied sciences recognizing the scientific excellence creativity and novelty as well as addressing unmet scientific and technological needs qin said dr cai is clearly a rising star among her peers her outstanding background in nanomaterials and unwavering drive to tackle the most complex challenges in the realm of brain disorders are unparalleled
cai also teamed up with dr robert bachoo associate professor of neurology and internal medicine at ut southwestern medical center to establish two glioblastoma animal models that recapitulate the gene mutations and tumor microenvironment that are commonly seen in human glioblastoma in animals the treatment approach was shown to decrease tumor size and increase survival rates
the promise of developing lab work into solutions for real people is what drew cai to ut dallas
i have a background in chemistry i have a lot of experience in nanoparticles but i always think what can i do with these things she said i always wanted to solve a problem to help people

are you a receptionist or are you a director of first impressions although the job duties might be identical that second title could cost you university of texas at dallas and harvard university researchers described in a new report
according to the study employees with inflated managerialsounding titles might be missing out on overtime pay  a practice that increases sharply right around the federal pay threshold that allows companies to avoid paying for overtime
the research published online by the national bureau of economic research in january was compiled by naveen jindal school of management faculty members dr umit gurun the stan liebowitz professor of accounting and of finance and managerial economics and dr bugra ozel associate professor of accounting and dr lauren cohen professor of finance at harvard business school
its all about the bottom line ozel said firms save 4 billion in overtime costs per year by inflating titles for workers however the loss of overtime results in 135 less pay than they might earn as a nonsalaried employee
and unfortunately ozel said the fines companies pay when they are caught by federal regulators amount to far less than the savings they realize by misclassifying workers who should be paid overtime
thats exactly the problem he said companies do it because its beneficial for them they do the calculation and realize that even if they get caught it will still probably have been worth doing
because the workers affected by these fake titles tend to make low wages its hard for them to fight for their lost pay
its difficult for the employees  theyre probably losing 2000 to 3000 a year because of this is it worth hiring a lawyer and fighting the company for it there has to be a mass of enough employees who are all suffering from this thing ozel said
generally nonsalaried workers are required to be paid oneandahalf times their hourly wage for any time worked over 40 hours in a week but a federal threshold for avoiding overtime pay for managers  first set in 1938  has only rarely been increased ozel said
the researchers found a systematic robust and sharp increase in firms use of managerial titles around the federally set salary cap which was 455 per week at the time the papers data set was collected
ozel and gurun think the regulation is outdated
the regulation has changed very little but the economy and conditions have changed a lot and sometimes regulations do not keep up with the changing conditions this is an example of that ozel said
many of the managerial titles they identified are obviously questionable such as grooming manager and assistant bingo manager but the practice of inflating job names is incredibly common gurun said
in all sorts of industries this one thing happens to be a trick on the laborers that corporations seem to be playing he said
its difficult for the employees  theyre probably losing 2000 to 3000 a year because of this
dr bugra ozel associate professor of accounting in the naveen jindal school of management
based on numbers from the bureau of labor statistics gurun said only one out of 50 people should be classified as a manager
but around the salary threshold you see this go up to three or four out of 50 people he said so you have to think is there anything else going on here
the proof appears to lie in the exceptions the researchers observed no similar jumps in managerial titles around any other monetary threshold besides the one that regulates overtime pay
in addition the five states that have the tightest regulations around overtime pay showed no such spikes in managerial titles around the federal pay threshold
the best solution is to change the federal regulation and simply pay people for time worked regardless of title gurun said
we can easily see what time you clocked in and how much you performed so it doesnt matter what the title is it doesnt matter if you have a fictitious managerial title he said we should pay people for what they do instead of who they are

according to the law a person can commit a hazing offense not only by engaging in a hazing activity but

the university of texas at dallas multicultural center is committed to recognizing the history of the universitys lands including the forced removal of indigenous peoples and legacy of colonization we believe that this acknowledgement is essential to our values as an organization that operates out of the office of diversity equity and inclusion
the multicultural center encourages faculty to include the following land acknowledgement in their syllabi and for all employees to include it in their email signature as a demonstration of support for our indigenous students and indigenous communities on and off campus

by danny cordovamulticultural center diversity education
the multicultural center developed this land acknowledgement via extensive research into the indigenous histories of the land where ut dallas now sits
the caddo confederacy stretched from north texas to the red river and east to what is now known as louisiana and into southern arkansas the caddo people were the leaders of the caddo nation an organized confederacy of at least 25 smaller tribes the confederacy was active until the 1800s and numbered 250000 at the height of their existence the spanish explorers of the 1600s referred to caddos as the great kingdom of tejas and called this area the land of the tejas the caddo confederacy was often referred to by the spanish as the tejas the hasinais were among the 25 tribes of the caddo confederacy and tejas is the spanish translation of the hasinais word tayshas those who are friends
the caddo people were the original founders and stewards of this land and were the true original texans the history of texas begins with the caddo confederacy and indigenous people
in 1961 eugene mcdermott j erik jonsson and cecil green established the graduate research center of the southwest grcsw the construction of the founders building the new home of the grcsw began in 1963 and was completed the next year in 1967 the grcsws name was changed to the southwest center for advanced studies scas in september 1969 the southwest center for advanced studies joined the ut system and became the university of texas at dallas
the founders building which housed the grcsw was built on 191 acres of farmland owned by fm and et armstrong when ut dallas joined the ut system in 1969 the 191 acres of farmland from the armstrong family along with farmland from cm walton 120 acres and jr black 160 acres was included as part of the purchase agreement in 1972 275 acres of land was donated to ut dallas by the hoblitzelle foundation to ut dallas for a total of 746 acres or 116 square miles the original road from the founders building to campbell road was named armstrong drive of which a small remnant is still located between university parkway and north loop rd many locals believed that armstrong drive was named after the american astronaut neil armstrong this was a common myth based on the belief that research was being conducted by the scas in partnership with the nasa apollo program of the late 1960s this was not true but it sure sounded good
prior to the establishment of the grcsw this area was primarily familyowned agricultural farmland and was often referred to as the blackland prairie farmlands were typically family owned and would have been primarily for personal livelihood and local trade wheat and cotton were grown seasonally in rotation along with other agricultural crops farms also included animals such as horses sheep chickens and cattle these farmlands were the foundation and an integral part of the growth of the city of richardson and collin county
little is known about the armstrong farmland such as the crops animals and when it was originally established however it would have resembled the adjacent farrell farmland the farrell farmland was located on the north side of the armstrong farmland established in 1891 the 365acre farmstead was a sizable wheat farm owned by hunter and mary farrell the farrells divorced in 1928 and mary then took ownership until turning the farm over to her daughter ammie who ran the farm until 1972 miss ammie was known as a champion sheep breeder after her passing the main farmhouse was converted to the plano heritage farmstead museum located on 15thstreet east of custer road the farrell and armstrong families would have been direct descendants of the peters colony established in the 1840s
immediately north of the farrell farmstead was the haggard farmland which is currently located at custer road and park boulevard in plano texas the haggard farmstead established in 1884 would have been adjacent to the north end of the farrell farmstead originally the haggard farm was a very large wheat and cotton farm and is still an operational wheat farm today however much of the land has since been sold or donated to the city of plano the haggard name can be found on current plano public buildings roads parks and schools today you can drive by the farm and see the llamas that were originally brought in to protect the sheep herds from coyotes in 2021 the city of plano approved a controversial mixeduse development on 46 acres of some of the last undeveloped haggard farmland near dallas north tollway between spring creek parkway and parkwood boulevard the developer designated to build the project is rutledge haggard of the haggard family the haggard farmlands and family are direct descendants of the peters colony established in the 1840s
to fully understand the history of the land in this area its important to understand the empresario land grants the grants were established by european investors as a strategy for colonization of other countries during the 1800s
empresario land grants were business contracts first given by spain continued by mexico and then by the texas republic spain created the land grants as a means of colonizing this area when mexico claimed independence from spain they continued the practice as a means of settling the northern area of mexico when the republic of texas was established the practice continued to enable the settlement of the north texas region as part of the empresario agreement or contract mexico required each empresario to claim mexican citizenship adopt catholicism and agree to settle a specific number of catholic families on a defined land grant the financial backing for these grants were typically made by european investors based in london england
to summarize as an example in 1821 stephen f austin was allotted 67000 acres by the mexican government to settle in the northern area of mexico near the brazos river he then recruited the first 300 families mostly europeans from united states and distributed to each family individual parcels of land to settle in turn the families paid a fee to austin for the land use many texas history narratives will often state that stephen f austin moved to texas the true story is he moved to mexico and became a mexican citizen the first 300 families also moved to mexico becoming mexican citizens texas as a state or republic did not exist in 1821 the area at the time was often referred to as indian territory claimed by mexico 
to clarify the term to settle can also be interchanged with the term to occupy depending on the perspective of the people involved and the narrative that is written
one of the central objectives of this project was to research the use and ownership of the enslaved and connection of the institution of slavery to the land the development of the land and the university in 1865 there was an estimated 250000 slaves in texas approximately 35 of the states population slave plantations were predominately located in south and east texas primarily for cotton and wheat production there are many wellwritten accounts discussing plantations slavery and the connections of the enslaved to the colonization of texas however for the purposes of this narrative the research showed that the austin colony was fully engaged in the slave trade and were owners of the enslaved including stephen f austin the research did not find any connection of the institution of slavery or the enslaved among the peters colony or to ut dallas
william peters prior to moving to the north texas region owned and operated a music store in louisville kentucky in 1840 william was granted an empresario grant from the republic of texas he started the peters colony which eventually led to the distribution of over 880000 acres of north texas free land to over 2200 families thirteen times the amount of free land given to the austin colony the first of these families from the peters colony settled in the breckenridge area the main town center was located on land that is now occupied by the dallas college richland campus the armstrong haggard and farrell families were descendants of the early european settlers that came to this north texas region as part of the peters colony land grant the original families that occupied this area were part of the peters colony and were the founders of the city of richardson plano mckinney allen and most if not all of the cities in the current north texas region the city of the colony is named in honor of the peters colony
prior to and during the arrival of the peters colony the land that ut dallas currently occupies was commonly known as indian territory and fully settled by the caddo people anthropologist have dated the caddos historical origins back to 800 ad the spanish explorers of the 1600s referred to caddos as the great kingdom of tejas and called this area the land of the tejas the caddo confederacy was often referred to by the spanish as the tejas the hasinais were among the 25 tribes of the caddo confederacy and tejas is the spanish translation of the hasinais word tayshas those who are friends
the caddo confederacy stretched from north texas to the red river and east to what is now known as louisiana and into southern arkansas the caddo people were the leaders of the caddo nation an organized confederacy of at least 25 smaller tribes the confederacy was active until the 1800s and numbered 250000 at the height of their existence
the caddo communities were complex and socially ranked societies with wellplanned civicceremonial centers they conducted elaborate mortuary rituals and ceremonial practices and engaged in extensive interregional trade their community centers had earthen mounds used as platforms for temple structures for civic and religious functions for burials of the social and political elite and for ceremonial fire mounds an example of these ceremonial mounds can be found in the town center of the city currently known as flower mound this mound was created by the neighboring wichita tribe some believe that wichita tribal leaders are still buried within this sacred mound
once texas became part of the united states in 1846 the state capitalized on the ability to use us federal troops to act on and enforce the 1830 us indian removal act in 1855 the caddo people along with all indigenous tribes were forcibly removed and relocated to the newly created brazos indian reservation this area is located 140 miles west of richardson in an area currently known as newcastle texas adjacent to the brazos river and fort belknap in 1859 the indigenous tribes were again forcibly removed and relocated to the washita river in indian territory in what is currently caddo county oklahoma the caddo nation of oklahoma is a federally recognized tribe located in binger oklahoma and are descendants of the historic caddo tribes
its important to note that the government of texas with support of white settlers and the us government took these violent removal actions soon after texas signed three significant peace treaties with the indigenous tribal leaders the 1843 treaty of birds fort located in what is currently arlington texas the 1844 treaty of tehuacana creek and the 1847 treaty of meusebachcomanche these violent actions starting in 1855 were taken for the removal of the all the indigenous people of texas for the purpose of seizing the land to make room for the continued colonization expansion and distribution of free land to the families of 1840s peters colony
the caddo people were the original founders and stewards of this land and were the true original texans the history of texas begins with the caddo confederacy and indigenous people
i am here only the representative of the caddos  my people live with the wichitas the lonies anadarkoes tawaconies kechies and southern delawares each one of these tribes once had a country and homes of their own each tribe once had a country where their ancestors had lived for generations and to which they were attached by ties and associations as sacred and dear as those that cluster in the memories and inspire the hearts of the white man for his country and home we have none nowthe story of our wrongs and sufferings is too long to be told you now  i will not attempt it chief white bread chief of the caddo 1888
i would like to recognize the following for their contribution and support in the development of these materials there were many conversations with numerous people on and off campus throughout the process of writing this narrative the people listed were especially crucial to the progress of this project

the cherokee indians had settled in the lands north of san antonio since 1819 this treaty was primarily about land boundaries and trade the parties declare that there shall be a firm and lasting peace forever and that a friendly intercourse shall be preserved by the people belonging to both parties the parties to this treaty agree that one or more agencies shall be created and at least one agent shall reside specially within the cherokee villages whose duty it shall be to see that no injustice is done to them or other members of the community of indians the republic of texas senate rejected the treaty saying that the consultation had exceeded its powers by confirming the cherokee land grants
this treaty was signed at birds fort on the arkikosa river now called the trinity river near present day arlington the treaty was intended to end years of hostilities and warfare between the native americans and the white settlers in texas a treaty of peace and friendship between the republic of texas and the delaware chickasaw waco tawakoni keechi caddo anadahkah ionie biloxi and cherokee tribes of indians
signed at tehuacana creek in mclennan county near the area currently known as waco texas
native americans andtexansagreed to cease all hostilities and establish more cooperative political and commercial ties a treaty of peace friendship and commerce between the republic of texas and the comanche keechie waco caddo anadakah ionie delaware shawnee cherokee lipan and tawakoni tribes of indians was concluded and signed at tehuacana creek
signed with the comanche chiefs on the lower san saba river and the area currently known as fredericksburg texas the treaty allowed meusebachs settlers to go unharmed into indian territory and the indians to go to the white settlements promised mutual reports on wrongdoing and provided for survey of lands in the san saba area with a payment of at least 1000 to the indians the treaty opened more than 3 million acres of land to settlement
the indian civilization act of 1819 was passed to encourage benevolent societies to provide education for the indian tribes and provided the authorization to encourage the civilization programs the act led to the formation of 52 schools over the next decade which were administered either by the federal government or by christian missions
the indian removal act of 1830 freed more than 25 million acres of fertile lucrative farmland to mostly white settlement in georgia florida north carolina tennessee alabama mississippi and arkansas more than 46000 native americans were forcedsometimes by the us militaryto abandon their homes and relocate to indian territory that eventually became the state of oklahoma this large movement is often referred to as the trail of tears
the indian appropriations act of 1841 allocated funds to move western tribes onto indian reservations where they would be protected and enclosed by the united states government according to the federal government at that time reservations were to be created in order to protect the indians from increasing numbers of white americans moving to the west this act set the precedent for modernday indian reservations
the homestead act of 1862 accelerated the settlement of the western territory by granting adult heads of families 160 acres of surveyed public land for a minimal filing fee and fiveyears of continuous residence on that land most of the land went to speculators cattle owners miners loggers and railroads of some 500 million acres dispersed by the general land office between 1862 and 1904 only 80 million acres went to homesteaders
the indian appropriation act of 1871 stated that no longer was any group of indians in the united states recognized as an independent nation by the federal government moreover congress directed that all indians should be treated as individuals and legally designated wards of the federal government thus this bill made it significantly easier for the federal government to secure lands that were previously owned by native americans
the indian appropriations act of 1885 act allowed indian tribes and individual indians to sell unoccupied lands that they claimed to be their own
the general allotment act of 1887 authorized the president to break up reservation land which was held in common by the members of a tribe into small allotments to be parceled out to individuals the act was the continuation effort to turn native americans into farmers instead of hunters and traders the land allotted to individuals included desert or neardesert lands unsuitable for farming in addition the techniques of selfsufficient farming were much different from their tribal way of life the dawes act had a disastrous effect on many tribes destroying traditional culture and society as well as causing the loss of as much as twothirds of tribal land
the indian appropriations act of 1889 act officially opened the unassigned lands to white settlers under tenets of the homestead act
the snyder act of 1921 authorized funds for the relief of distress and conservation of health among american indians the act defines the governments responsibility for american indian health care and is one of several legislative reforms in the works to improve the living conditions for american indians on reservations and in government boarding schools
the indian reorganization act conserved and developed indian lands and resources to extend to indians the right to form business and other organizations to establish a credit system for indians to grant certain rights of home rule to indians to provide for vocational education for indians and for other purposes the act intended to reverse the assimilationist policies that had resulted in considerable damage to american indian cultures and to provide a means for american indians to reestablish sovereignty and selfgovernment to reduce the losses of reservation lands and to build economic selfsufficiency
the indian termination act of 1953 eliminated much government support for indian tribes including health care and social services and ended the protected trust status of all indianowned lands the us governments efforts to assimilate american indians into mainstream culture can be seen throughout the 20th century in the bureau of indian affairs bia activities
the indian relocation act of 1956 was the impetus for the relocation of the large number of native americans now living in urban areas though the act didnt force people to leave their reservations it made it hard for families to stay by dissolving federal recognition of most tribes and ending federal funding for reservations schools hospitals and basic services along with the jobs they created the federal government paid for relocation expenses to the cities and provided some vocational training
the indian health care improvement act of 1976 amended the social security act to permit reimbursement by medicare and medicaid for services provided to american indians and alaska natives in indian health service ihs and tribal health care facilities in doing so congress recognized that many indian people especially those residing in very remote and rural locations were eligible for but could not access medicaid and medicare services without traveling sometimes hundreds of miles to medicaid and medicare providers located off reservation

individual faculty or staff members are encouraged to provide a firstlevel response to problem student behavior unless the behavior is threatening or warrants more serious attention by the university experience indicates that despite the common fear that responding to problem behaviors will escalate the trouble the opposite is usually true students often express gratitude when faculty members respond effectively to problem behaviors however it is important to know ones own limitations in providing assistance to students to learn more refer to the following resources
often the best response is to listen carefully and then to encourage the student to seek help at the student counseling center you may call the center for a consultation if you are unsure of an appropriate intervention or if the student is reluctant to accept your referral the following indicators may be useful in assessing whether or not a referral should be made
disruptive behavior an individual student exhibiting inappropriate behavior should be approached in a private conversation that includes a description of the problem behavior and the specific consequences
stating a need for help if a student comes to a facultystaff member with a direct request for help that student probably will value a recommendation for a referral to a professional
talking about suicide if a student talks or writes about suicide this should be taken seriously if the student includes actual plans for suicide the severity of the danger to the student increases dramatically suicide is often considered an option when the person feels hopeless trapped out of control or depressed to make the assumption that talk of suicide is aimed solely toward getting attention can be a potentially fatal mistake if you become aware of a student who is considering suicide please make an immediate referral to the counseling center
observable changes some students do not state directly that there is a problem but their behaviors can be telling indicators distinct changes in academic performance withdrawal from others changes in class participation crying outbursts of anger increased or decreased activity and poor attendance are examples of significant behavioral changes any of these observable changes may merit a referral to the counseling center
physical complaints students who repeatedly report physical illness or symptoms may be experiencing psychological problems a change in eating patterns sleep disturbances fatigue stomach aches and pain are some common complaints that may be related to psychological problem
alcohol and drug abuse coming to class or a meeting when intoxicated or high is a serious signal often people drink or take drugs as a way to cope with and alleviate other problems in their life unfortunately the substance abuse itself may become a problem that interferes with social academic and work functioning
academic problems students who have a noticeable decline in their academic performance may be feeling overwhelmed with other areas of their lives some students come to classes with difficulty concentrating completing assignments or performing well on exams
the behavior assessment and intervention team bait reviews behavioral incidents and ensures a systematic response to students whose behavior may be disruptive or harmful to themselves or the ut dallas community the team assists in protecting the health safety and welfare of students and other members of the ut dallas community

in 2018 the university of texas at dallas submitted its newest quality enhancement plan qeptitled new transfer student successto the southern association of colleges and schools commission on colleges sacscoc our regional accreditor as part of the reaffirmation of accreditation process
our qep is an ambitious multiyear project aimed at enhancing transfer support services across campus and ensuring that all new transfer students are engaged and feel a sense of belonging at ut dallas it is the culmination of a yearslong effort to gather institutional data analyze student outcomes improve support programs and services and equip our students to succeed both in and out of classrooms
ut dallas overarching mission as stated in our strategic plan is to graduate wellrounded citizens whose education has prepared them for rewarding lives and productive careers in a constantly changing world new transfer student success is one of the many ways that were working to make that vision a reality
to retain our status as a public research universityand to remain in good standing with sacscocut dallas must undergo a decennial reaffirmation of accreditation process which typically takes 23 years to complete this comprehensive review of all university operations ensures that ut dallas adheres to the highest possible institutional standards the qep is an integral part of this process a symbol of our ongoing commitment to upholding the principles and best practices established by sacscoc
but our qep represents more than the mere fulfillment of sacscoc policy it is our promise to both current and future studentsand to residents across the state of texasthat we will pursue excellence in education and research by continuously striving to improve student learning outcomes to enhance curricular and cocurricular supports across campus and to help all students learn grow and thrive during their time at ut dallas
with a qep focused on transfer student successand with the inauguration of our new office of community college relationswe are committed to developing stronger partnerships with two and fouryear institutions across north texas and beyond and transforming ut dallas into one of the states most transferready universities
situated in the dallasfort worth metroplexand in close proximity to two large community college systems collin college and dallas collegeour university has been a goto destination for transfer students interested in a toptier baccalaureate education
transfer students make up more than 32 of our current undergraduate population ranging in age from 17 to 74 they arrive at ut dallas with diverse experiences and educational backgrounds we have exemplary transfer student retention ratesaccording to the most recent data approximately 81 of our students persist from year one to year twobut we know that students who transfer between institutions often face a variety of challenges as they acclimate to new academic and social environments although 48 of our transfer students are 22 years old and younger thus similar in age to traditional firsttimeincollege students some of our students have reported that theyve struggled to meet likeminded peers establish a healthy schoolworklife balance or connect to our campus community
new transfer student success ntss creates a framework for helping new transfer students overcome these challenges feel a sense of belonging on campus and develop the skills theyll need to succeed at ut dallas and in their chosen career paths
developed with the most current student success research in mindwith a particular focus on sense of belonging and student engagementntss aims to boost student learning outcomes and thus both retention and graduation rates by encouraging new transfer students to participate in what george kuh vincent tinto and others refer to as highimpact practices of the many such practices in place at ut dallas ntss is designed to enhance two in particular peer mentoring and firstyear experiences
aiming to help new students adjust to campus weve developed an innovative peer mentoring program that matches transfer students with more advanced transfer student mentors who can provide support encouragement and helpful advice during that crucial first year on campus
we believe that new students will benefit from close contact with an experienced peer who has already successfully navigated the transfer process our goal as we work to expand the program is to eventually provide meaningful mentoring opportunities for all interested incoming transfer students
we are also working to increase new transfer students facetoface interactions with their peers as well as with ut dallas faculty and staff through the creation of enhanced transfer orientation programming in consultation with current transfer students and key faculty and administrative stakeholders weve spearheaded efforts to enhance the orientation experience for new transfer students so that they can better develop meaningful connections with peers and student groups take advantage of university supports and excel in their chosen fields of study
alongside these initiatives weve gathered a crosscampus group of stakeholders to redesign our transfer equivalency tool which will make it easier for prospective students and student advisors to evaluate transfer credits and thus make the best decisions possible when it comes to major and course selection were also developing a new transfer services website that will colocate information thats currently found across several different web environments making it easier for students to find key information before during and after they enroll at ut dallas
although these projects are not formal qep initiatives they are led by the qep stakeholder team and play an important role in making ut dallas a more transferready institution
we know that students face a variety of obstacles when they transfer from one institution to another ntss is an integral part of our ongoing institutional efforts to simplify the transfer process and improve transfer student success
from its founding in 1969 as a small private institute for graduate students ut dallas has grown to become one of the nations preeminent public research institutions recognized in 2015 as a toptier research i university by the carnegie classification of institutions of higher educationand propelled in part by the rapid economic growth of the dallasfort worth metroplexwe are the fourthfastestgrowing university in the united states exciting as this is such explosive growth carries with it new challenges for our institution as we work to maintain exceptional educational standards for a growing and diverse student body
beginning in 2015 we initiated the reaffirmation of accreditation by soliciting ideas for our next quality enhancement plan we analyzed best practices at toptier universities across the nation and we invited faculty staff and students to serve on numerous qeprelated committees we also solicited detailed proposals from stakeholders across campus and carried out a robust analysis of institutional data and student development research
after a thorough review of all available information we realized that the most effective qep would be one that enhanced highimpact programs for firstyear students with this in mind we took a holistic view of the firstyear experience and developed an initiative known as orbit keeping new comets on course that aimed to improve support services for all new ut dallas students firsttimeincollege students transfer students international students and graduate students we also created a group called the new student engagement board made up of stakeholders across campus who oversee new student programming and coordinate campuswide student support efforts
but as we examined the scope of orbitand as we worked in consultation with sacscoc reviewers to refine our qepwe came to believe that one student group in particular would benefit from enhanced support services as well as the development of new highimpact programs transfer students
aiming to deepen transfer students sense of belonging at ut dallaswhich we define as their sense of purpose and agency to achieve educational personal and professional goals as they recognize that they are respected valued and included in all aspects of the campus environmentwe retained the overarching orbit initiative while narrowing our qep to focus on improving the new student experience for all ut dallas transfer students
submitted to sacscoc in 2018 new transfer student success represents our ongoing efforts to develop highimpact firstyear programs to enhance curricular and cocurricular supports and to help new transfer students connect with members of our campus community and feel a sense of belonging to ut dallas
weve made strategic adjustments to our qep since we submitted it to sacscoc prompted by institutional developments and the onset of the covid19 pandemic these changes will be detailed in our 5th year report
if you would like to read our quality enhancement planor find out more about the selection and development of the qepplease check out the following resources
the gateways to excellence in math and science gems quality enhancement plan was designed to improve student learning outcomes in gateway math and science courses specifically chemistry and calculus our qep led to a curriculum redesign in various math and science courses to ensure students were achieving learning outcomes and to establish new methods of learning enhancement such as peer and electronic instruction outside of classes the qep culminated in the creation of the student success center which provides all ut dallas students with academic coaching tutoring peerled team learning and other instructional supports

editors note the donor has chosen a different direction for the placement of his collection and therefore the barrett collection will not become a part of the growing arts collections and initiatives at ut dallas
the university of texas at dallas utd announced the gift to the university of the barrett collection consisting of over 400 works of swiss art it is the singlelargest donation ever made to utd as well as the largest gift of art to any school in the university of texas system this unparalleled collection of paintings sculpture drawings and prints is the only definitive collection of swiss art outside of switzerland and is considered the largest and finest private collection of swiss art ever formed with works dating from the late 14ththrough the mid20thcentury the barrett collection includes important pieces by every major artist born in switzerland from caspar wolf 17351783 the first painter of the swiss alps to cuno amiet 18681961
recognized for its excellence in science engineering and business utd has recently placed greater emphasis on the arts with the creation of the edith odonnell institute of art history in 2014 the university has fostered innovative research and graduate education in the history of art embracing a global history of art that ranges across geography chronology and medium the gift of the barrett collection which will be housed in a new barrett museum to be built on campus will extend the vision for the odonnell institute attracting new scholars and expanding the role of the arts across the university
the arts are an essential facet of any great university said dr richard c benson president of utd i am grateful to the barretts for this generous gift which will catalyze the development of arts programs at the odonnell institute at utd and provide our students with direct access to an extraordinary collection
the collection was started in the 1990s by dallas residents nona and richard barrett as a result of extensive travel in the country they realized early on that outside of switzerland swiss art was widely unknown underappreciated and undervalued after an early visit to the collection of mme monique barbiermueller in geneva they made their first acquisition at art basel of a painting by ferdinand hodler relying on knowledge gleaned through research and their rapidly developing private library along with guidance from curators dealers and art historians the barretts have become the most knowledgeable american collectors of swiss art of the past two generations this has enabled them to build the present collection often acquiring works before they reach the market since nonas death in 2014 richard and his present wife luba have continued to expand the collection
we have benefited so much from our city of dallas and are glad to have an opportunity to give something back our wish is for our collection to remain intact and have a permanent public home in our own city as well as in texas the building of the barrett museum on the utd campus not only will achieve that but will enable the collection to continue to grow through future support from the barrett collection foundation said richard barrett our dearest hope is that this gift will enhance the cultural fabric of this fine university
noted both for its completeness and the depth of holdings of works by the most important swissborn artists the barrett collection has drawn the attention of art historians curators and museum directors from around the globe works from the collection have been on view at major art institutions internationally including the tate britain kunsthaus zurich the metropolitan museum of art and the muse dorsay among others representative works in the collection include
dr richard brettell a scholar of modern painting and founding director of the odonnell institute has known the collection since its inception he has worked closely with the barretts to develop plans for the museum which will be unique in the world outside switzerland
the creation of a museum with a collection of this breadth and depth of swiss art at its core is unprecedented in the united states but bringing this collection to a major research university makes the significance of the gift even greater brettell said the focus and range of the barrett collection will spark many new dissertations articles and books written by our graduate students and faculty
in addition to the works currently in the collection utd will also receive funding from the barrett collection foundation for future acquisitions including works by postworld war ii and contemporary swiss artists
about the barrett collection
the major works of the barrett collection demonstrate the range of swiss artists who traveled and spent extensive periods in russia england spain austria france germany and italy in addition to their native switzerland thus the barrett collection is devoted in its fullest sense to european art seen through the lens of swissborn artists the core of the collection is composed of 11 works by caspar wolf 12 by angelika kauffmann seven by heinrich fssli six by arnold bcklin 50 by the 19thcentury swiss landscape masters 38 by ferdinand hodler 34 by felix vallotton and 41 by cuno amiet the collection also includes works by artists less wellknown outside switzerland itself as well as artists who often are considered french lopold robert and marc gabriel charles gleyre or italian sigismund righini and giovanni segantini the barretts amassed a virtually definitive collection of the work of giovanni giacometti father of the more famous alberto and diego giacometti and their cousin augusto giacometti whose chromatic paintings and works on paper are scarcely collected outside switzerland the collection also has several works by artists whose careers are only now being carefully studied including max buri and ernest biler
the following examples highlight the depth and breadth of the barrett collection
jeanetienne liotard maria theresa empress of austria 1762 the two most powerful women in the world in the 18thcentury were catherine the great of russia and maria theresa empress of the austrohungarian empire whose large family intermarried with virtually every other important royal family of europe liotard traveled to vienna to paint the empress and her family first in 1742 returning several times during those visits he represented the empress herself in pastel and oil and made drawings and paintings of all her children in what is among the most sustained collective portraits of a royal family by any european artist the barrett collection portrait is pastel on vellum and relates to the official portrait in oil and seems to be done about the same time as a somewhat more elaborate pastel now in the collection of the muse des beaux arts in the artists native geneva
angelika kauffmann ulysses on the island of circe 1793 angelika kauffmann was during her lifetime famous throughout europe and was one of only two female artists who were founding members of the royal academy in london fluent in several european languages she was at home in most of the capital cities of the continent and made paintings on commission for aristocrats and intellectuals her portrait of the youthful goethe painted in rome is an example her greatest ambition like most male artists of her generation was to excel as a history painter and she made largescale exhibition paintings throughout her life the barrett collection holdings of works by kauffmann is virtually definitive and contains in addition to portraits and small scale mythological and literary paintings two largescale history paintings both involved with the life of ulysses ulysses on the island of circeis the largest and was painted during the artists later years in rome where she died in 1807
ferdinand hodler landscape with rhythmic shapes 1908 ferdinand hodler was the principal painter from switzerland during his lifetime and is the only swiss painter to take his place in the pantheon on modern painting the barrett collections 38 works form a true retrospective of his pictorial achievements on canvas and paper and represent his career from its earliest landscapes painted for tourists to his elaborate figural allegories in the end hodlers rhythmic landscapes of his native switzerland particularly of lac lman lake geneva around which he lived much of his life are his most perfect works and the rhythmic landscape in the barrett collection makes fully evident hodlers fascination with the parallels between the visual rhythms of nature and the rhythms of music like many advanced artists of his generation hodler believed in synesthesia in which color and sound composed by painters and musical composers are fundamentally unified
cuno amiet women in the garden 1910 of the masters of swiss modernism  ferdinand hodler felix vallotton and cuno amiet  the latter is the least known outside his native country yet in his fascinating interactions with the two competing forms of artistic modernism  the french and the german he made important contributions to both amiet started his vanguard career by training at the academie julian in paris and went to pontaven in brittany to follow in the footsteps of his hero paul gauguin his fluency in german and his fascination with the early forms of what is now known as german expressionism led him to early membership in the berlinbased group die brcke later in his career this bicultural modernism and his relationship with the great collectors of modernist paintings josef mller and his sister gertrud dubimller gave him firsthand knowledge of works by van gogh gauguin and kandinsky this 1910 painting women in the garden is part of a series of paintings that approach the french notion of the decorative but injecting it with a chromatic power that belies its gentle subject
giovanni giacometti bathers alberto and diego 1919giovanni giacometti was not italian as his name suggests but swiss and descended from a family living in the italianspeaking stampa switzerland where he painted assisted the great italianborn swiss painter segantini and raised a family devoted to art two of his three sons alberto and diego giacometti left this part of switzerland as young men for paris where alberto with the assistance of diego became one of the most famous artists in the world often considered french alberto was selected by the french government to be the artist for the french pavilion of the 1962 venice biennale hence forever confusing his national origins in this work in the barrett collection we see their father representing his two soontobe famous sons swimming on a beautiful summer day in switzerland the barrett collection includes more than 25 works by giovanni giacometti and his lesswellknown but even more inventive artistcousin augusto giacometti making it possible to understand the swiss roots of this dynasty of european artists
