have known since the 19th century that corresponding region of the left and right hemisphere of the brain dont always perform the same function imaging study have more recently documented this lateralization in the context of chronic pain specifically in the amygdala where emotional processing also occurs a team of researcher led by dr benedict kolber associate professor of neuroscience in the school of behavioral and brain science at the university of texas at dallas ha demonstrated in mouse that a single neuropeptide ha opposite effect on chronic bladder pain when the molecule is active in matching region of opposite hemisphere of the brain the research wa published in the feb 15 print issue of the journal biological psychiatry this finding is particularly striking it flip side of the same coin said kolber who is corresponding author of the study and is affiliated with the center for advanced pain study at utd it bizarre it speaks to the flexibility of natural system while in many case there redundancy there can also be specialization that evolves kolbers team conducted it study on a mouse model of bladder pain when the researcher introduced the protein calcitonin generelated peptide cgrp to the animal amygdala they found that cgrp administered in the right side increased behavioral sign of bladder pain but when administered in the left side it decreased painlike behavior in the bladder there are other example in the amygdala of situation in which one side ha a specialized receptor that increase pain and the other side doesnt do anything but none with counteractive effect like this kolber said cgrp is driving pain on the right side and reducing pain on the left lead author dr heather allen a ut dallas visiting scholar and a postdoctoral associate at new york university said that lateralization is often ignored in pain research this finding is particularly striking it flip side of the same coin it bizarre it speaks to the flexibility of natural system while in many case there redundancy there can also be specialization that evolves dr benedict kolber associate professor of neuroscience in the school of behavioral and brain science here we demonstrate that bladder pain visceral pain in a centrally located organ is processed differently on the left and right side of the brain she said if we had focused on only one side of the amygdala we would have completely missed out on discovering these divergent function kolbers area of expertise is urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome an umbrella term for variety of pain that affect an estimated 10 million people in the u each year primarily middleaged woman it a huge area of clinical need and we dont know how to treat it he said so while this is a broader story about lateralization were also seeking specific answer the patient is the priority i want to understand this disease so it can be treated in human to learn more about how ut dallas is enhancing life through transformative research explore new dimension the campaign for ut dallas kolber said there have probably been hundred of study that went unpublished by researcher who moved on because they assumed there wa no difference between hemisphere he said his group result could enable progress in research on other medical condition including stroke depression and some learning and memory phenomenon were discovering something about nature something fundamental thats really exciting he said allen said the next step is to identify the reason for the polar opposite behavior on matching side of the brain in response to the same neuropeptide we are currently investigating the signaling pathway from cgrppositive cell in the amygdala to other part of the brain to see if that provides any evidence she said we are also investigating these finding in other pain model to evaluate if this phenomenon is isolated to bladder pain or whether it extends to other type of pain chronic pain treatment are often ineffective largely because we still dont truly understand the underlying mechanism understanding these pain pathway will hopefully help u design effective therapeutic in the future additional contributor to the research include ut dallas neuroscience research associate dr lakeisha lewter and cognition and neuroscience doctoral student veronica hong a well a researcher from the university of pittsburgh and

to provide farmer with accurate realtime continuous data to improve soil health and productivity this is the equivalent of having a wearable health sensor on your body that tell you in realtime whats happening think of it a a wearable for the soil said dr shalini prasad department head of bioengineering and the cecil h and ida green professor in system biology science in the erik jonsson school of engineering and computer science we are excited about the potential for our soil sensor to provide more accurate testing of living soil in it ecosystem prasad who ha developed wearable sensor technology to monitor various human health condition such a diabetes received research funding through a twoyear ut dallas intellectual property assignmentsponsored research agreement ipasra to investigate the use of electrochemical method to ass soil health for industry partner soil in formation sif a public benefit corporation in january sif sponsored additional research to advance the

wearable for the soil dr shalini prasad the cecil h and ida green professor in system biology science in the erik jonsson school of engineering and computer science electrochemical soil testing involves applying electrical stimulation to the soil and measuring chemical reaction to the voltage prasads team described the testing of soil using electrochemical sensor in an article published june 29 2022 in the journal of the electrochemical society the method developed by ut dallas researcher measure ph moisture volumetric bulk density and the two main soil carbon pool level of soil organic matter and carbonaceous soil mineral a well a total soil carbon the intellectual property assignment sponsored research agreement ipasra model at ut dallas provides an industry sponsor the opportunity to own the intellectual property ip that result from a sponsorfunded research project giving the sponsor ownership of the ip upfront eliminates much of the risk and uncertainty around license negotiation and the subsequent financial obligation prasad said the sensor represents a paradigm shift in soil testing typically soil is tested by digging up a sample and sending it to a lab or it is evaluated remotely by infrared method or satellite sif wanted to develop a more direct and accurate method for testing soil a a dynamic living ecosystem henry rowlands the company research and development lead said this new soil health monitoring technology developed by utd researcher significantly improves the accuracy and auditability of soil test result the sensor developed at utd should provide data that farmer and other stakeholder can use to improve soil health and mitigate climate change by improving soil ability to draw down carbon from the atmosphere rowlands said a soil quality decline from damaging agricultural practice the technology could play a role in enabling the improvement of soil health on a global scale which also could help address food insecurity rowlands said

included six firsttier recipient ut dallas wa the only institution with more than two awardees in 2022 when madhurantakams fatherinlaw in india came down with a mild case of covid19 in 2020 the family thought he wa better off recovering at home when he didnt seem to recover the family took him to the hospital but within three day he died madhurantakam who wa conducting postdoctoral work in japan and wa not allowed to travel to india at the time saw the medical problem very clearly caretaker and hospital staff had no way to tell which covid19 patient needed a high level of hospital care and who would recover at home she joined dr shalini prasads biomedical microdevices and nanotechnology laboratory at ut dallas to develop a way to quickly detect the severity of a patient infection the method us an electrochemical sensing technique originated by prasad department head of bioengineering and the cecil h and ida green professor in system biology science madhurantakams technology us a blood sample to show whether a patient ha covid19 and if so the severity of the disease the walletsized device sens the patient immune system response to covid19 with a strong response correlating to a more serious case of the disease within minute the device can detect the level of four kind of biomarkers even before a patient show symptom of infection the development of a device that is useful to the community and society is the major contribution i can make said madhurantakam who also lost several other family member to covid19 i dont want to do research that is just limited to publication i want to develop technology that are useful to people banga also earned a baxter award for a disease detection device a handheld breath analyzer that can detect respiratory disease including covid19 within second when covid started we were all sitting at home banga said one day dr prasad asked whether we could design an electrochemical sensor for covid we were getting report that covid wa affecting people lung capacity i thought that might be a good starting point this breath analyzer platform is a firstofitskind screening tool for coronavirus detection in under five second said banga who previously wa selected a one of two runnersup for a young chemist award from laboratory equipment manufacturer metrohm usa the device detects level of volatile organic compound in the breath that increase when a patient ha covid19 or other respiratory infection bangas future work includes studying the device potential for detecting other serious disease it is exciting to see the great stride our doctoral student and early career researcher are making in developing cuttingedge technology that demonstrates promise in translating from bench to bedside or to home prasad said the nurturing and vibrant environment at ut dallas play a critical role in empowering these young mind to dream big for a global impact cai work with dr zhenpeng qin associate professor of mechanical engineering and fellow eugene mcdermott professor and other researcher in his lab ondeveloping a techniqueto temporarily open the bloodbrain barrier to deliver medicine to the brain on one side this can help our brain be healthy maintain normal function she said about the dynamic barrier that protects the brain on the other side it prevents the drug from getting into the brain with qin cai and her colleague developed a method to temporarily prop open cell in the membrane using gold nanoparticles to allow medicine to enter they showed that the approach is safe and doesnt harm blood vessel or brain activity that mean for example that cancer medication might be delivered into the brain to treat glioblastoma a particularly deadly type of cancer due to the difficulty of getting medication past the brain barrier to the tumor the prestigious baxter award is a coveted honor in the field of engineering and applied science recognizing the scientific excellence creativity and novelty a well a addressing unmet scientific and technological need qin said dr cai is clearly a rising star among her peer her outstanding background in nanomaterials and unwavering drive to tackle the most complex challenge in the realm of brain disorder are unparalleled cai also teamed up with dr robert bachoo associate professor of neurology and internal medicine at ut southwestern medical center to establish two glioblastoma animal model that recapitulate the gene mutation and tumor microenvironment that are commonly seen in human glioblastoma in animal the treatment approach wa shown to decrease tumor size and increase survival rate the promise of developing lab work into solution for real people is what drew cai to ut dallas i have a background in chemistry i have a lot of experience in

first impression although the job duty might be identical that second title could cost you university of texas at dallas and harvard university researcher described in a new report according to the study employee with inflated managerialsounding title might be missing out on overtime pay a practice that increase sharply right around the federal pay threshold that allows company to avoid paying for overtime the research published online by the national bureau of economic research in january wa compiled by naveen jindal school of management faculty member dr umit gurun the stan liebowitz professor of accounting and of finance and managerial economics and dr bugra ozel associate professor of accounting and dr lauren cohen professor of finance at harvard business school it all about the bottom line ozel said firm save 4 billion in overtime cost per year by inflating title for worker however the loss of overtime result in 135 le pay than they might earn a a nonsalaried employee and unfortunately ozel said the fine company pay when they are caught by federal regulator amount to far le than the saving they realize by misclassifying worker who should be paid overtime thats exactly the problem he said company do it because it beneficial for them they do the calculation and realize that even if they get caught it will still probably have been worth doing because the worker affected by these fake title tend to make low wage it hard for them to fight for their lost pay it difficult for the employee theyre probably losing 2000 to 3000 a year because of this is it worth hiring a lawyer and fighting the company for it there ha to be a mass of enough employee who are all suffering from this thing ozel said generally nonsalaried worker are required to be paid oneandahalf time their hourly wage for any time worked over 40 hour in a week but a federal threshold for avoiding overtime pay for manager first set in 1938 ha only rarely been increased ozel said the researcher found a systematic robust and sharp increase in firm use of managerial title around the federally set salary cap which wa 455 per week at the time the paper data set wa collected ozel and gurun think the regulation is outdated the regulation ha changed very little but the economy and condition have changed a lot and sometimes regulation do not keep up with the changing condition this is an example of that ozel said many of the managerial title they identified are obviously questionable such a grooming manager and assistant bingo manager but the practice of inflating job name is incredibly common gurun said in all sort of industry this one thing happens to be a trick on the laborer that corporation seem to be playing he said it difficult for the employee theyre probably losing 2000 to 3000 a year because of this dr bugra ozel associate professor of accounting in the naveen jindal school of management based on number from the bureau of labor statistic gurun said only one out of 50 people should be classified a a manager but around the salary threshold you see this go up to three or four out of 50 people he said so you have to think is there anything else going on here the proof appears to lie in the exception the researcher observed no similar jump in managerial title around any other monetary threshold besides the one that regulates overtime pay in addition the five state that have the tightest regulation around overtime pay showed no such spike in managerial title around the federal pay threshold the best solution is to change the federal regulation and simply pay people for time worked regardless of title gurun said we can easily see what time you clocked in and how much you performed so it doesnt matter what the title is it doesnt matter if you have a fictitious managerial title he said we should pay people for what they do instead of who they are medium contact jessica good ut dallas 9728834319 jessicagoodutdallasedu or the office of medium

dallas now sits the caddo confederacy stretched from north texas to the red river and east to what is now known a louisiana and into southern arkansas the caddo people were the leader of the caddo nation an organized confederacy of at least 25 smaller tribe the confederacy wa active until the 1800s and numbered 250000 at the height of their existence the spanish explorer of the 1600s referred to caddo a the great kingdom of tejas and called this area the land of the tejas the caddo confederacy wa often referred to by the spanish a the tejas the hasinais were among the 25 tribe of the caddo confederacy and tejas is the spanish translation of the hasinais word tayshas those who are friend the caddo people were the original founder and steward of this land and were the true original texan the history of texas begin with the caddo confederacy and indigenous people in 1961 eugene mcdermott j erik jonsson and cecil green established the graduate research center of the southwest grcsw the construction of the founder building the new home of the grcsw began in 1963 and wa completed the next year in 1967 the grcsws name wa changed to the southwest center for advanced study scas in september 1969 the southwest center for advanced study joined the ut system and became the university of texas at dallas the founder building which housed the grcsw wa built on 191 acre of farmland owned by fm and et armstrong when ut dallas joined the ut system in 1969 the 191 acre of farmland from the armstrong family along with farmland from cm walton 120 acre and jr black 160 acre wa included a part of the purchase agreement in 1972 275 acre of land wa donated to ut dallas by the hoblitzelle foundation to ut dallas for a total of 746 acre or 116 square mile the original road from the founder building to campbell road wa named armstrong drive of which a small remnant is still located between university parkway and north loop rd many local believed that armstrong drive wa named after the american astronaut neil armstrong this wa a common myth based on the belief that research wa being conducted by the scas in partnership with the nasa apollo program of the late 1960s this wa not true but it sure sounded good prior to the establishment of the grcsw this area wa primarily familyowned agricultural farmland and wa often referred to a the blackland prairie farmland were typically family owned and would have been primarily for personal livelihood and local trade wheat and cotton were grown seasonally in rotation along with other agricultural crop farm also included animal such a horse sheep chicken and cattle these farmland were the foundation and an integral part of the growth of the city of richardson and collin county little is known about the armstrong farmland such a the crop animal and when it wa originally established however it would have resembled the adjacent farrell farmland the farrell farmland wa located on the north side of the armstrong farmland established in 1891 the 365acre farmstead wa a sizable wheat farm owned by hunter and mary farrell the farrell divorced in 1928 and mary then took ownership until turning the farm over to her daughter ammie who ran the farm until 1972 miss ammie wa known a a champion sheep breeder after her passing the main farmhouse wa converted to the plano heritage farmstead museum located on 15thstreet east of custer road the farrell and armstrong family would have been direct descendant of the peter colony established in the 1840s immediately north of the farrell farmstead wa the haggard farmland which is currently located at custer road and park boulevard in plano texas the haggard farmstead established in 1884 would have been adjacent to the north end of the farrell farmstead originally the haggard farm wa a very large wheat and cotton farm and is still an operational wheat farm today however much of the land ha since been sold or donated to the city of plano the haggard name can be found on current plano public building road park and school today you can drive by the farm and see the llama that were originally brought in to protect the sheep herd from coyote in 2021 the city of plano approved a controversial mixeduse development on 46 acre of some of the last undeveloped haggard farmland near dallas north tollway between spring creek parkway and parkwood boulevard the developer designated to build the project is rutledge haggard of the haggard family the haggard farmland and family are direct descendant of the peter colony established in the 1840s to fully understand the history of the land in this area it important to understand the empresario land grant the grant were established by european investor a a strategy for colonization of other country during the 1800s empresario land grant were business contract first given by spain continued by mexico and then by the texas republic spain created the land grant a a mean of colonizing this area when mexico claimed independence from spain they continued the practice a a mean of settling the northern area of mexico when the republic of texas wa established the practice continued to enable the settlement of the north texas region a part of the empresario agreement or contract mexico required each empresario to claim mexican citizenship adopt catholicism and agree to settle a specific number of catholic family on a defined land grant the financial backing for these grant were typically made by european investor based in london england to summarize a an example in 1821 stephen f austin wa allotted 67000 acre by the mexican government to settle in the northern area of mexico near the brazos river he then recruited the first 300 family mostly european from united state and distributed to each family individual parcel of land to settle in turn the family paid a fee to austin for the land use many texas history narrative will often state that stephen f austin moved to texas the true story is he moved to mexico and became a mexican citizen the first 300 family also moved to mexico becoming mexican citizen texas a a state or republic did not exist in 1821 the area at the time wa often referred to a indian territory claimed by mexico to clarify the term to settle can also be interchanged with the term to occupy depending on the perspective of the people involved and the narrative that is written one of the central objective of this project wa to research the use and ownership of the enslaved and connection of the institution of slavery to the land the development of the land and the university in 1865 there wa an estimated 250000 slave in texas approximately 35 of the state population slave plantation were predominately located in south and east texas primarily for cotton and wheat production there are many wellwritten account discussing plantation slavery and the connection of the enslaved to the colonization of texas however for the purpose of this narrative the research showed that the austin colony wa fully engaged in the slave trade and were owner of the enslaved including stephen f austin the research did not find any connection of the institution of slavery or the enslaved among the peter colony or to ut dallas william peter prior to moving to the north texas region owned and operated a music store in louisville kentucky in 1840 william wa granted an empresario grant from the republic of texas he started the peter colony which eventually led to the distribution of over 880000 acre of north texas free land to over 2200 family thirteen time the amount of free land given to the austin colony the first of these family from the peter colony settled in the breckenridge area the main town center wa located on land that is now occupied by the dallas college richland campus the armstrong haggard and farrell family were descendant of the early european settler that came to this north texas region a part of the peter colony land grant the original family that occupied this area were part of the peter colony and were the founder of the city of richardson plano mckinney allen and most if not all of the city in the current north texas region the city of the colony is named in honor of the peter colony prior to and during the arrival of the peter colony the land that ut dallas currently occupies wa commonly known a indian territory and fully settled by the caddo people anthropologist have dated the caddo historical origin back to 800 ad the spanish explorer of the 1600s referred to caddo a the great kingdom of tejas and called this area the land of the tejas the caddo confederacy wa often referred to by the spanish a the tejas the hasinais were among the 25 tribe of the caddo confederacy and tejas is the spanish translation of the hasinais word tayshas those who are friend the caddo confederacy stretched from north texas to the red river and east to what is now known a louisiana and into southern arkansas the caddo people were the leader of the caddo nation an organized confederacy of at least 25 smaller tribe the confederacy wa active until the 1800s and numbered 250000 at the height of their existence the caddo community were complex and socially ranked society with wellplanned civicceremonial center they conducted elaborate mortuary ritual and ceremonial practice and engaged in extensive interregional trade their community center had earthen mound used a platform for temple structure for civic and religious function for burial of the social and political elite and for ceremonial fire mound an example of these ceremonial mound can be found in the town center of the city currently known a flower mound this mound wa created by the neighboring wichita tribe some believe that wichita tribal leader are still buried within this sacred mound once texas became part of the united state in 1846 the state capitalized on the ability to use u federal troop to act on and enforce the 1830 u indian removal act in 1855 the caddo people along with all indigenous tribe were forcibly removed and relocated to the newly created brazos indian reservation this area is located 140 mile west of richardson in an area currently known a newcastle texas adjacent to the brazos river and fort belknap in 1859 the indigenous tribe were again forcibly removed and relocated to the washita river in indian territory in what is currently caddo county oklahoma the caddo nation of oklahoma is a federally recognized tribe located in binger oklahoma and are descendant of the historic caddo tribe it important to note that the government of texas with support of white settler and the u government took these violent removal action soon after texas signed three significant peace treaty with the indigenous tribal leader the 1843 treaty of bird fort located in what is currently arlington texas the 1844 treaty of tehuacana creek and the 1847 treaty of meusebachcomanche these violent action starting in 1855 were taken for the removal of the all the indigenous people of texas for the purpose of seizing the land to make room for the continued colonization expansion and distribution of free land to the family of 1840s peter colony the caddo people were the original founder and steward of this land and were the true original texan the history of texas begin with the caddo confederacy and indigenous people i am here only the representative of the caddo my people live with the wichita the lonies anadarkoes tawaconies kechies and southern delaware each one of these tribe once had a country and home of their own each tribe once had a country where their ancestor had lived for generation and to which they were attached by tie and association a sacred and dear a those that cluster

to indian territory that eventually became the state of oklahoma this large movement is often referred to a the trail of tear the indian appropriation act of 1841 allocated fund to move western tribe onto indian reservation where they would be protected and enclosed by the united state government according to the federal government at that time reservation were to be created in order to protect the indian from increasing number of white american moving to the west this act set the precedent for modernday indian reservation the homestead act of 1862 accelerated the settlement of the western territory by granting adult head of family 160 acre of surveyed public land for a minimal filing fee and fiveyears of continuous residence on that land most of the land went to speculator cattle owner miner logger and railroad of some 500 million acre dispersed by the general land office between 1862 and 1904 only 80 million acre went to homesteader the indian appropriation act of 1871 stated that no longer wa any group of indian in the united state recognized a an independent nation by the federal government moreover congress directed that all indian should be treated a individual and legally designated ward of the federal government thus this bill made it significantly easier for the federal government to secure land that were previously owned by native american the indian appropriation act of 1885 act allowed indian tribe and individual indian to sell unoccupied land that they claimed to be their own the general allotment act of 1887 authorized the president to break up reservation land which wa held in common by the member of a tribe into small allotment to be parceled out to individual the act wa the continuation effort to turn native american into farmer instead of hunter and trader the land allotted to individual included desert or neardesert land unsuitable for farming in addition the technique of selfsufficient farming were much different from their tribal way of life the dawes act had a disastrous effect on many tribe destroying traditional culture and society a well a causing the loss of a much a twothirds of tribal land the indian appropriation act of 1889 act officially opened the unassigned land to white settler under tenet of the homestead act the snyder act of 1921 authorized fund for the relief of distress and conservation of health among american indian the act defines the government responsibility for american indian health care and is one of several legislative reform in the work to improve the living condition for american indian on reservation and in government boarding school the indian reorganization act conserved and developed indian land and resource to extend to indian the right to form business and other organization to establish a credit system for indian to grant certain right of home rule to indian to provide for vocational education for indian and for other purpose the act intended to reverse the assimilationist policy that had resulted in considerable damage to american indian culture and to provide a mean for american indian to reestablish sovereignty and selfgovernment to reduce the loss of reservation land and to build economic selfsufficiency the indian termination act of 1953 eliminated much government support for indian tribe including health care and social service and ended the protected trust status of all indianowned land the u government effort to assimilate american indian into mainstream culture can be seen throughout the 20th century in the bureau of indian affair bia activity the indian relocation act of 1956 wa the impetus for the relocation of the large number of native american now living in urban area though the act didnt force people to leave their reservation it made it hard for family to stay by dissolving federal recognition of most tribe and ending federal funding for reservation school hospital and basic service along with the job they created the federal government paid for relocation expense to the city and provided some vocational training the indian health care improvement act of 1976 amended the social security act to permit reimbursement by medicare and medicaid for service provided to american indian and alaska native in indian health service ihs and tribal health care facility in doing so congress recognized that many indian people

counseling center you may call the center for a consultation if you are unsure of an appropriate intervention or if the student is reluctant to accept your referral the following indicator may be useful in assessing whether or not a referral should be made disruptive behavior an individual student exhibiting inappropriate behavior should be approached in a private conversation that includes a description of the problem behavior and the specific consequence stating a need for help if a student come to a facultystaff member with a direct request for help that student probably will value a recommendation for a referral to a professional talking about suicide if a student talk or writes about suicide this should be taken seriously if the student includes actual plan for suicide the severity of the danger to the student increase dramatically suicide is often considered an option when the person feel hopeless trapped out of control or depressed to make the assumption that talk of

collection and therefore the barrett collection will not become a part of the growing art collection and initiative at ut dallas the university of texas at dallas utd announced the gift to the university of the barrett collection consisting of over 400 work of swiss art it is the singlelargest donation ever made to utd a well a the largest gift of art to any school in the university of texas system this unparalleled collection of painting sculpture drawing and print is the only definitive collection of swiss art outside of switzerland and is considered the largest and finest private collection of swiss art ever formed with work dating from the late 14ththrough the mid20thcentury the barrett collection includes important piece by every major artist born in switzerland from caspar wolf 17351783 the first painter of the swiss alp to cuno amiet 18681961 recognized for it excellence in science engineering and business utd ha recently placed greater emphasis on the art with the creation of the edith odonnell institute of art history in 2014 the university ha fostered innovative research and graduate education in the history of art embracing a global history of art that range across geography chronology and medium the gift of the barrett collection which will be housed in a new barrett museum to be built on campus will extend the vision for the odonnell institute attracting new scholar and expanding the role of the art across the university the art are an essential facet of any great university said dr richard c benson president of utd i am grateful to the barretts for this generous gift which will catalyze the development of art program at the odonnell institute at utd and provide our student with direct access to an extraordinary collection the collection wa started in the 1990s by dallas resident nona and richard barrett a a result of extensive travel in the country they realized early on that outside of switzerland swiss art wa widely unknown underappreciated and undervalued after an early visit to the collection of mme monique barbiermueller in geneva they made their first acquisition at art basel of a painting by ferdinand hodler relying on knowledge gleaned through research and their rapidly developing private library along with guidance from curator dealer and art historian the barretts have become the most knowledgeable american collector of swiss art of the past two generation this ha enabled them to build the present collection often acquiring work before they reach the market since nonas death in 2014 richard and his present wife luba have continued to expand the collection we have benefited so much from our city of dallas and are glad to have an opportunity to give something back our wish is for our collection to remain intact and have a permanent public home in our own city a well a in texas the building of the barrett museum on the utd campus not only will achieve that but will enable the collection to continue to grow through future support from the barrett collection foundation said richard barrett our dearest hope is that this gift will enhance the cultural fabric of this fine university noted both for it completeness and the depth of holding of work by the most important swissborn artist the barrett collection ha drawn the attention of art historian curator and museum director from around the globe work from the collection have been on view at major art institution internationally including the tate britain kunsthaus zurich the metropolitan museum of art and the muse dorsay among others representative work in the collection include dr richard brettell a scholar of modern painting and founding director of the odonnell institute ha known the collection since it inception he ha worked closely with the barretts to develop plan for the museum which will be unique in the world outside switzerland the creation of a museum with a collection of this breadth and depth of swiss art at it core is unprecedented in the united state but bringing this collection to a major research university make the significance of the gift even greater brettell said the focus and range of the barrett collection will spark many new dissertation article and book written by our graduate student and faculty in addition to the work currently in the collection utd will also receive funding from the barrett collection foundation for future acquisition including work by postworld war ii and contemporary swiss artist about the barrett collection the major work of the barrett collection demonstrate the range of swiss artist who traveled and spent extensive period in russia england spain austria france germany and italy in addition to their native switzerland thus

18thcentury were catherine the great of russia and maria theresa empress of the austrohungarian empire whose large family intermarried with virtually every other important royal family of europe liotard traveled to vienna to paint the empress and her family first in 1742 returning several time during those visit he represented the empress herself in pastel and oil and made drawing and painting of all her child in what is among the most sustained collective portrait of a royal family by any european artist the barrett collection portrait is pastel on vellum and relates to the official portrait in oil and seems to be done about the same time a a somewhat more elaborate pastel now in the collection of the muse de beau art in the artist native geneva angelika kauffmann

true retrospective of his pictorial achievement on canvas and paper and represent his career from it earliest landscape painted for tourist to his elaborate figural allegory in the end hodlers rhythmic landscape of his native switzerland particularly of lac lman lake geneva around which he lived much of his life are his most perfect work and the rhythmic landscape in the barrett collection make fully evident hodlers fascination with the parallel between the visual rhythm of nature and the rhythm of music like many advanced artist of his generation hodler believed in synesthesia in which color and sound composed by painter and musical composer are fundamentally unified cuno amiet woman in the garden 1910 of the master of swiss modernism ferdinand hodler felix vallotton and cuno amiet the latter is the least known outside his native country yet in his fascinating interaction with the two competing form of artistic modernism the french and the german he made important contribution to both amiet started his vanguard career by training at the academie julian in paris and went to pontaven in brittany to follow in the footstep of his hero paul gauguin his fluency in german and his
